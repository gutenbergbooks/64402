<small>WE ARE NOT ALL MONEY-CRAZED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> eminent Bishop of the Episcopalian diocese
of New York has spent practically his whole life
among people of wealth and fashion and their associates.
He has made some brief excursions, but his
social relations, his intimacies have been altogether
with what Parton calls &#8220;the triumphant classes.&#8221;
He knows the plutocracy; his diocese lies in its
stronghold, includes many of its most conspicuous
and aggressive leaders both in making and spending
money. There can be no question of his qualification
to speak authoritatively of it, of its mode
of living and thinking. He has said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear a group of young girls whose fresh youth
one would think ought, in the matter of their most
tender and sacred affection, to be as free from sordid
instinct as from the taint of a godless cynicism.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
You will find that they have their price, and are
not to be had without it any more than a Circassian
slave in the market of Bagdad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>&#8220;If the first comers to these shores were to come
back to-day and see the houses, the dress and the
manners of their descendants, they would think
themselves in London in the time of Charles, or in
Versailles in the time of the Louises.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he went on to urge the rich &#8220;to illustrate
in their habit of life simplicity of attire, inexpensiveness
in the appointments and chasteness in the
aspect, proportions, furniture and decorations of
their dwellings,&#8221; he could have meant only that he
finds the Americans whom he knows best for the
most part ostentatious and extravagant in dress,
prodigal and vulgar and ignorantly profuse in their
dwellings. And when he charged them with having
&#8220;the buying of legislatures as their highest distinction&#8221;
and with &#8220;appropriating the achievements of
the scholar, the inventor, the pioneer in commerce
or the arts, without rewarding them for the products
of their genius,&#8221; he framed an indictment not
on belief but on knowledge which becomes tremendous
in view of the conservative character of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
mind and his training, the dignity and responsibility
of his position and the unequalled opportunity
that is his to know whereof he speaks.</p>

<p>Lord Methuen, felled in a trifling engagement in
the Boer war by one of those flesh wounds that are
most painful but not serious, telegraphed home,
&#8220;This is the bloodiest battle in history.&#8221; His point
of view was rather too personal. And somewhat
so must it have been with the Bishop when he concluded
his survey of the encompassing plutocracy
with this wild, despairing cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole people are corrupted and corrupting!
Moloch is god and his shrine is in almost
every household in the republic!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fifth avenue and Wall street are not all of Manhattan
Island: Manhattan Island is not all of New
York City; New York City is not the only city in
America; and outside the cities in every direction
stretch vast areas of American soil not without its
population. The plutocracy is a phase, not the
whole. If the distinguished Bishop were as competent
to speak of the American people as he is of the
plutocracy, we might well feel that it is all over
with the republic&mdash;that we Americans have bartered
our birthright for a few handfuls of yellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
earth and richly deserve our fate of social, political
and industrial serfdom.</p>

<p>But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is as exact a truth as any in chemistry or
mechanics that Aristocracy is the natural, the inevitable
sequence of widespread ignorance, and
Democracy the natural, the inevitable sequence of
widespread intelligence.</p>

<p>An intelligent few may be, as in Russia to-day,
crushed down by an unintelligent mass wielded by
a tyrant or group of tyrants. An unintelligent mass
may for a time get, as in modern England, some
measure of liberty through the mutual jealousies
of intelligent upper classes warring one with another
for supremacy. But let intelligence be diffused,
let the sluices be opened so that it flows
through the social soil in every direction and the
tendency toward Democracy becomes irresistible.
Monarchs may plot. Venerable and long-venerated
institutions of princely and priestly and property
caste and privilege may thunder, &#8220;Thus far and no
farther!&#8221; Schools and colleges may give an education
of half-truths and prejudices. Philosophers
may deplore and warn, may project subtle and
alluring schemes for maintaining or rehabilitating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
the old tyrannies in a new form. New conditions
may produce new and subtle tyrannies that seem
stronger than the old. All in vain. As well might
a concourse of parliaments and tongues resolve that
the heat of the sun be reduced one-half.</p>

<p>In face of any and all obstacles, in face even of
the determination of a whole people, confused by
false education, refusing to be free and rallying
to the defense of some beloved tradition of caste,
Democracy marches on hardly more hindered than
an epidemic by the incantations of a &#8220;medicine
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inertia is characteristic of the great mass of
human beings, whatever their stage of development.
And if the combat against the instinctive,
all but universal reluctance to change had no
stronger weapons than the tongues and pens of
&#8220;reformers,&#8221; men would still be huddled in caves,
gnawing bones. It is by no effort of its own that a
race or a nation moves. It is in obedience to conditions
that cannot be resisted and that now gently
and now rudely compel man to readjust himself or
to perish.</p>

<p>Democracy does not appreciably advance by the
energy and enthusiasm of those who believe in it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
any more than it greatly lags because of the machinations
of those who secretly or openly oppose it.
Energy and enthusiasm may hasten its formal
recognition, its formal embodiment in written laws.
On the other hand, adroitness may obtain a lease of
formal existence for the outgrown institutions. But
in neither case is the great essential fact of the
progress of Democracy altered. This progress depends
upon the diffusion of intelligence; and intelligence
is not a matter of individual choice or even of
formal education. If the eyes and the ears are
open, if the mental faculties are normal, then
wherever intelligence is diffusing, there the mind
must be drinking it in. A sponge thrown into the
water must become saturated. When intelligence
permeates the masses, then out of the action and
reaction of the common and the conflicting interests
of an ever-increasing multitude of intelligent men
there must begin to issue a democratic compromise
self-government.</p>

<p>Thus Democracy is not a &#8220;cult&#8221; to rise and rage
and perish. It is not a theory that may some day
be discovered false. It is not a plant to be carefully
watched and watered lest peradventure it die.
It is a condition, an environment, an atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
A force as irresistible as that which keeps the stars
a-swinging is behind it. The story of history,
rightly written, would be the story of the march of
Democracy, now patiently wearing away obstacles,
accelerated there, now sweeping along upon the surface,
again flowing for centuries underground, but
always in action, always the one continuous, inevitable
force. There never has been any more danger
of its defeat than there has been danger that the
human brain would be smoothed of its thought-bearing
convolutions and set in retreat through the
stages of evolution back to protoplasm.</p>

<p>Until this last half-century it was extremely difficult
to study the operations of any great world-principle.
But discovery and invention have now
given us sight far more penetrating than that of
the fabled giant who could see the grass grow.
The difficulty now is to avoid seeing and knowing.
And to shut out all but some relatively unimportant
phenomenon&mdash;suddenly and suspiciously acquired
wealth here, a corrupt and extravagant or degraded
public administration there, a strike or a riot or a
momentary moral convulsion yonder&mdash;and from it
to predict the approach of chaos with tyranny upon
its back, is as childish as the fantastic alarms of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
tribe of savages during an eclipse or a thunder
storm.</p>

<p>That any in America should thus shut the eyes,
say &#8220;It is night,&#8221; and grope and tremble, is more
discreditable than a similar folly among Englishmen
or Frenchmen or Germans. Democracy has
been our familiar from the very beginning, and
self-government and the absence of rule are as old
as our oldest settlements.</p>

<p>Those miserable first settlers, with minds as
small and mean as their cabins, had no conception
either of freedom or self-government. The tyrannies
theological and tyrannies political which they
set up to make life as hateful as it was squalid show
that they had brought their European ideas with
them. But fate was against them. They were of
about the same low social rank. They were poor&mdash;and
poverty is as potent a leveller as death itself.
They were isolated. They had to shift each man
for himself. So, deprived of rulers and forced to
be free, since none cared to bind them, they began
to govern each man himself. And they took the
material tools which the civilization then current in
Europe forced into their hands and, to save themselves
from starvation, they set about the conquest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
of the land, not for a State as they imagined, but
for themselves and their children.</p>

<p>Freedom is not the American&#8217;s because constitutions
or statutes assert it. The constitutions, the
statutes are merely written records of a truth no
more dependent upon them than the proportions in
which elements combine are dependent upon the
text-books of chemistry. Besides, constitutions and
laws avail only through their interpreters. And
interpretation varies with the honesty or open-mindedness
of official interpreters, with the spirit of the
time, with the caprice of the moment even&mdash;a popular
outburst, an impulse of bad courage in the public
administrations, a greedy fear or desire in some
powerful class. Legal enactments affect the surface
of a society more or less and for periods of
varying brevity; but the society itself is formed by
conditions over which man has no greater control
than he has over his heart-action. Those conditions
constitute what the religious call &#8220;God in history&#8221;
and the unreligious call fate or destiny or natural
evolution.</p>

<p>America will remain in the highway to freedom
because printing presses are whirling, because railway
trains are moving, because news is streaming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
along the telegraph wires, because schools and colleges
and libraries are open&mdash;because intelligence is
diffused and is ever more widely diffusing. Rights
may be and constantly are assailed in isolated instances.
But each instance remains and must remain
isolated. None has become or can become a
precedent. And there must be precedent or there
can be no tyranny. Prejudice, even wilful prejudice,
still thrives; truth and error have not yet been
divorced from their unholy alliance which seduces
honest men to the purposes of rascals; passion still
rules the heart and the heart still rules the reason.
But America must be free, however hard it may
struggle against freedom; Intelligence is striking
off the shackles. It can no more be stopped or
stayed than the law of gravitation can be suspended.</p>

<p>The European, or the American returning from
a visit to Europe, is always disagreeably impressed
by the evidences of haste, of imperfection in detail,
by &#8220;the ragged ends sticking out.&#8221; But after a
moment&#8217;s consideration of the reasons for this
slovenliness wise criticism is disarmed. In the
busiest hundred years the world has ever seen the
Americans have had to shape out of a trackless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
wilderness a complete civilization containing as
many as possible of the good ideas of the world&#8217;s
past and having also all the latest improvements.
There has been no time to &#8220;gather up loose ends.&#8221;
The filling in of gaps, the replacing of makeshifts
with permanent structures, the finishing and the
polishing, have been perforce left to posterity. And,
thanks to the passing and the present generations,
posterity will have the leisure and the resources,
and also the finer qualifications, necessary to that
part of the task of civilization-building.</p>

<p>The shortcomings of to-day, as nationally characteristic
as our energy and our mental alertness,
are most obvious, of course, in the public administration&mdash;disagreeable
in the national administration,
painful in the state administration, shocking
in the municipal administration. Because of these
spectacles of sloth, incompetence and corruption in
public officials, it is charged by many persons of
reputation as &#8220;publicists&#8221; that Democracy is a
breeder of public corruption. The truth is just the
reverse. Democracy drags public corruption out of
its mole-tunnels where it undermines society, drags
it into the full light of day, draws its deadly fangs
that fasten in fundamental human rights, cuts its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
fatal claws that sink deep into the throat of freedom.
One sees and hears more of public corruption
in a Democracy than in a State. An organism
that is expelling disease at its surface <i>looks</i> worse
than one which is hiding and fostering disease in its
vitals.</p>

<p>Corruption is no offspring of Democracy. It is
co-existent with human passions and weaknesses.
Society is but a conglomerate of individuals; the
whole, with all the strength of all the parts, has also
all their weakness. In a State the public administration
is the parlor; in a Democracy it is the servants&#8217;
hall. Public corruption in a State means that
the head of the house is corrupt; public corruption
in a Democracy means that the servants need attention.</p>

<p>Our serious public corruption&mdash;national, State
and municipal&mdash;is of a kind unknown to the people
of two generations ago. About the middle of the
last century science developed to the point at which
it was able to give man weapons adequate to the
thorough conquest of nature and of natural difficulties.
The American people at once seized these most
timely tools and began the rapid conquest of their
vast, undeveloped heritage. Forty years ago this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
was a sturdy but dull and monotonous agricultural
nation. It was hindered in intercourse with the rest
of civilization by the wide ocean, across which passage
was slow, painful, dangerous. It had a sparse,
scattered population leading a severe and sodden
rural or semi-rural life. There were no cities in
the modern sense, practically no railroads, few and
wretched wagon roads, few factories, no great distributing
agencies, no telegraphs. Each section
was shut off from, was ignorant and suspicious of,
the others. Opportunities for advancement, for
individual elevation, did not, as now, press upon
even the incompetent and unworthy through very
profusion, but were rare, uncertain and narrow.</p>

<p>From the recent great industrial-social revolution
has emerged the America of to-day&mdash;a land
undreamed by our forefathers, uncomprehended by
ourselves. In every essential of life&mdash;in education,
in comfort, in refinement&mdash;there has been an immeasurable
advance. And, most important of all,
intelligence and that divine, truly democratic spirit
of discontent, which has ever been the harbinger of
enlightened progress, have penetrated to the remotest
farmhouses, and fight a valiant and a winning
battle with the sloth and despair of our city<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
slums. Incidental to this evolution, inseparable
from it, logically and naturally a part of it, there
have been myriad opportunities for a temptation
to corruption. And our corruption has complied
with corruption&#8217;s universal law. It has been in
direct proportion to opportunity.</p>

<p>As long as only old and familiar forms had to
be combated the people did not feel, as they do
now, the inadequacy, the utter unfitness of their
electoral machinery for the work of selecting and
controlling their public administrators. This machinery,
with some slight changes, is the same that
was used in Athens and that was borrowed by the
Greeks from the Egyptians. It is the crudest and
clumsiest device possible for registering the public
will. It works fairly well in small communities
where the people are not busy, where everybody
knows everybody else, where public administrators
can be held to strict personal account by their
neighbors, their masters.</p>

<p>Until the two last centuries the world had little
use for electoral machinery. And until the last
fifty years, at most, there were no conditions that
forcibly demanded the invention of a new electoral
machine&mdash;one that would permit a people to register<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
their will quickly, without circumlocutions, and
at the same time without the haste that makes right
action an accident.</p>

<p>In addition to this fundamental disadvantage
our people are also contending against an almost
equally unfortunate limitation. The industrial
revolution presses into private service not merely
all of the best minds of the nation, but also most of
the minds in which large measures of both capacity
and character are combined. Even the mediocres
who would best fill public office&mdash;which in a Democracy
should be obedient and never initiatory&mdash;have
been impressed by high pecuniary rewards into private
service. But demand creates supply. Give us
a little time and our supply will once more equal the
demands upon it. We are manufacturing competent,
intelligent men and women workers by the
tens and the hundreds of thousands now-a-days&mdash;faster
than private enterprise can absorb them, in
such vast numbers that not the richest plutocracy
could seduce and silence all or even a large proportion
of them. Give us a little time, another thirty
years or so&mdash;at most.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let us not forget:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;That while we ought to be, and are, concerned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
about the purity and efficiency of our public
administrations, our vital interest is in the projects
and acts of the industrial leaders who here ignore,
there cajole or bully, the public administration,
now use and now defy it.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;That the new form of public corruption
is an incident&mdash;melancholy, deplorable, dreadful,
but still only a necessary incident&mdash;in that
swift yet permanent betterment of man&#8217;s condition
which practically began in the childhood of men
still young.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;That while purchasers of inequality and
of privilege to extort may evade the laws of the
statute books, they cannot evade that law of Democracy
which compels them to assist in raising the
consuming and producing capacities of the people,
the standards of enlightenment, of comfort, of refinement,
of civilized desire&mdash;of intelligence! The
plutocrats themselves are, in the quaint irony of
fate, by no means the least efficient of our manufacturers
of democrats.</p>

<p>It is not rational, it is distinctly irrational, to
assert that moral or mental or physical betterment
can tend to disaster, that the growth of intelligence
may make men seek to tear down and tear up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
fabric of civilization. It is true that the people&mdash;not
here only, but throughout civilization and wherever
civilization touches&mdash;are growing more restless,
ever less content, ever more inquisitive, ever
less reverential to tradition and authority. But are
not these the very qualities which, working in the
minds of the few in the past, led the human race
up from the caves? Newspapers, libraries, schools
do not make Huns and Vandals. On the contrary,
they tame and eradicate that savagery which is the
largest part of the estate we have inherited from
our ancestors; on the contrary, they destroy the
Huns and Vandals of inequality and privilege who
would wrest from man his heritage under Intelligence
and Democracy.</p>

<p>As for our own people, whose fate has been forecast
in so many jeremiads, how would any man or
body of men set about subjecting millions upon millions
who are not merely educated but are also
<i>intelligent</i>? The world has heretofore offered no
opportunity for the trial of any such experiment
in enslavement. The experiment if tried must be,
indeed, original in conception and in execution. Is
there hazard in the prophecy that no man now on
earth will live to see it tried? Is there hazard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
even in the prophecy that it never will be tried?
To assume that such an experiment could have any
measure of success is to become involved in contradictions
and absurdities. Make out the perils that
beset our Democratic path as formidable as you
please, and still it is less contradictory and absurd
to assume that we shall triumph over them.</p>

<p>How will we do it? It is not given to man to
foresee even one minute of his own future. But,
since triumph we must, rest assured that triumph
we shall. If you wish to make a shrewd guess as
to the how of it, watch the motions of that infant of
yesterday, Science. Already Science has given to us
all a thousand things that not the richest of our
grandparents could afford, nor the most powerful
command. Beyond question it will presently unlock
the secrets of the composition of matter and show
us how every object that now enters into private
wealth or is rationally sought by human desire can
be obtained so easily by a little effort on the part of
any human being that a man would as soon think
of devoting himself to bottling sunshine as to storing
up what is now called wealth. Less than two
human generations of scientific activity, and already
what ominous groanings and crackings in the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
remaining of the artificial barriers that have so long
dammed up the riches of the earth as wealth to be
withheld or doled out by the few. Science is the
emancipator, the deliverer, the mighty equalizer
and leveler&mdash;equalizing and leveling <i>up</i>. Not
down, but up, always up. Not by making the rich
poor, but by making the poor rich. Not by making
the wise foolish, but by making the foolish wise.
Not by enfeebling the powerful, but by making
powerful the feeble.</p>

<p>For signs of the world&#8217;s to-morrow, look not in
the programs of political parties, not in the plottings
of princes or plutocrats, but in the crucible of
the chemist.</p>

<p>We have reminded ourselves of the solid ground
upon which rests our faith in ourselves as a democratic
people with a democratic future. We can
therefore proceed, with fairly tranquil minds, to
view some of the &#8220;perils&#8221; to the republic. And
of these the greatest, the one that includes them
all, is the plutocracy, which fills so many of our
thinkers with grim forebodings. Instead of lying
awake o&#8217; nights, worrying about it, let us go boldly
and democratically forth in the broad day and gaze
straight at it in all its grisly vulgarity.</p>

<small>THE MANIA FOR GILT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> stand in front of a huge dam. Its wall
rises bare and sheer. You say to yourself: &#8220;There
can be little water behind it.&#8221; But even as you
think this, the dam becomes a waterfall, and the
waterfall swells into a Niagara. You go round
where you see the other side; you find a lake
fathoms deep and extending miles up the valley.</p>

<p>Precisely such a phenomenon occurred in this
country a few years ago. Behind a dam of long-established
customs of simplicity and frugality,
concentrated private wealth had been rising for a
generation with amazing rapidity. Suddenly it
overflowed in a waterfall of luxurious living; and
to-day the waterfall has become a Niagara.</p>

<p>The dam that has pent and narrowed the streams
of national wealth is the concentration of property
that has come about through the imperfect working<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
of the law of combination which steam and electricity
established. That imperfection has produced
the multi-millionaire, the plutocrat, as the
crowning inequality in a succession of inequalities.
First, the man with a million or so; then the man
with ten millions or so; then the man with fifty
millions or so; now, the man with a hundred, with
five hundred, with nearly a thousand millions.
Every city has its plutocrats. In New York is the
capital of plutocracy. As businesses combine, as
wealth concentrates, the directors of business, the
masters of wealth, segregate. Thus, New York
is denuding the rest of the country of its plutocrats.
Most of them live in New York now; the rest must
soon come.</p>

<p>The mighty cataract of extravagant ostentation
is continent-wide&mdash;from Boston to San Francisco.
In New York, the high-curving centre of the down-pouring,
glittering stream, the spectacle almost
passes belief. There is not the least danger of
exaggeration in description; the danger is lest they
who have not seen with their own eyes may refuse
to believe that men and women can be born under
the American flag wild enough to indulge in such
prodigality and pretense and folly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>A score of years ago there were in New York
only a few private houses that could accurately be
spoken of as palaces; to-day there are more than
two hundred private houses that are indeed palaces
in size, in cost, and in showiness; and hardly a
week passes without announcement of several new
ones of equal or surpassing splendor. Twenty years
ago there were not in all so many as a score of
palace-like hotels, apartment houses and business
buildings; to-day there are more than five hundred
of these wonderful structures of marble and granite
over iron, each costing, with its equipment, decorations
and furnishings, from two to six millions.</p>

<p>And the whole city&mdash;business quarters and industrial,
rich quarters and poor&mdash;is in a state of
chaotic upheaval, so furiously are they tearing
down the New York that was new twenty years
ago, and replacing it with a New York, in every
quarter and every street significant of the presence
of colossal wealth, of stupendous private fortunes,
of an unprecedented and unbelievable number of
great incomes.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago the number of private equipages
on New York&#8217;s streets was noticeably small,
considering the city&#8217;s size and wealth, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
appointments for the most part extremely modest.
To-day Fifth avenue and Central Park, from September
to mid-June, are thronged with handsome
private carriages, notably costly in all details of
harness and upholstery, the servants in expensive,
often gaudy liveries; and the multitude of women
thus swept along in state, in beautiful dresses
and hats and wraps, frequently display fortunes in
furs and jewels.</p>

<p>As for the shops, it seems indeed only yesterday
that you found the costly luxuries in a few fashionable
places, and there in small quantities and almost
reverently handled by clerks and customers. To-day
the shops where the tens of thousands buy are
more luxurious than were most of the best shops
ten years ago. And in the best shops you are dazzled
and overwhelmed by the careless torrent of
luxury&mdash;enormous quantities, enormous prices,
throngs of customers. Twenty-five dollars for a
pair of shoes, fifteen dollars for a pair of stockings,
two hundred dollars for a hat, one thousand dollars
for a hat-pin or parasol, fifteen hundred for a
small gold bottle for a woman&#8217;s dressing-table,
thirty or forty thousand for a tiara, a hundred
thousand for a string of pearls&mdash;these are prices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
which salesmen will give you with the air of one
who tells an oft-told tale.</p>

<p>Why has an income of ten thousand a year become
a mere competence in New York City to-day?
Why do the families with ten times ten thousand
regard themselves as far from rich? Why do
enough New Yorkers to make a populous city regard
it as privation if they cannot keep at least
three servants, one of them a man-servant, and
ride in cabs and have a country place in summer?</p>

<p>The explanation is&mdash;the multi-millionaire.</p>

<p>There are in New York City to-day upward of
a thousand fortunes of two or more millions.
About one-fourth of these are of more than ten
millions. There are no less than forty-eight fortunes
of more than forty millions, about twenty of
these being more than seventy-five millions, and
half a dozen of them between seventy-five millions
and the mountainous aggregations of the Oil King&mdash;three-quarters
of a billion, with an income beyond
forty-five millions a year.</p>

<p>There is no way of estimating the number of
fortunes of from three-quarters of a million to two
millions. The income of a million dollars, safely
invested, is about forty thousand a year. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
New York men&mdash;several thousands&mdash;have from
their profession or their business annual incomes,
available for living expenses, of forty thousand or
thereabouts, yet their holdings of property are
small. But they belong in the millionaire class because
they spend money like the millionaires and
are of the most strenuous part of the plutocracy.</p>

<p>It is the multi-millionaires who set and force the
pace&mdash;the families with incomes of more than a
quarter of a million a year. &#8220;A man with a hundred
thousand a year,&#8221; said the late Pierre Lorillard,
with humorous seriousness, &#8220;is in the unhappy
position where he can see what a good time he could
have if he only had the money.&#8221; And he added
that easy circumstances meant &#8220;a thousand dollars
a day&mdash;and expenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Properly and comfortably to live in the style
which New York most envies and admires and encourages,
a family should have an income of three-quarters
of a million at least. But by economy
and abstention from too great self-indulgence, and
by Spartan resistance to many fascinating temptations,
they may keep up the appearances of a very
high degree of luxury on a quarter of a million a
year. Of course, they cannot have very many or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
very grand houses; they must not think of racing
stables; they would do well to keep out of yachts;
they must expect to be frequently and far outshone
in jewels and in entertainments; they must
keep down their largess, their benevolences. But
they can have a small house in town, one or two
more in the country, can entertain creditably if they
do not entertain too often, and can live&mdash;if they
are prudent&mdash;free from the harassments of money
cares.</p>

<p>The quickest way to get at the reason for this
curious state of affairs, that may seem to many a
flamboyant jest rather than conservatively presented
reality, is to look at the life of the typical
New York multi-millionaire of the extravagant
class. There are multi-millionaires, scores of them,
who do not belong in this extravagant class; but
there are not so many outside of it now as there
were five years ago.</p>

<p>Our up-to-date, luxury-hunting, luxury-teaching
Mr. Multi-Millionaire has a fortune which is estimated
at thirty millions, but is ten millions more
or less in the widest fluctuations of the stock market.
His income is about a million and a half a
year, but he usually spends three-quarters of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
million, and relies upon speculation to put him in
funds for extraordinary expenditures, such as a
new house, a large gift to education or charity, a
large purchase of pictures or jewels.</p>

<p>As human beings compare themselves only with
those in better circumstances, he counts himself
poor rather than rich&mdash;his fellow-citizens, the Oil
King, and the Copper King, and the Sugar King,
and the Steel King, and the Telegraph King, and
the Tobacco King, and the Real Estate King are
what he calls rich. He thinks himself unlucky
rather than lucky; he avoids intimacy with men
of smaller fortunes and no fortunes unless he has
known them long, because he suspects that he is
usually sought with a view to exploitation&mdash;and he
is not far from right. He thinks he is opposed to
ostentation, severely criticises his richer neighbors
and loudly applauds frugality.</p>

<p>He has a wife who is forty-five years old and
passes for &#8220;about thirty.&#8221; They have a son who
has been out of college four years, and after learning
enough of business to supervise a fortune, has
settled down to the life of a &#8220;gentleman&#8221;; a daughter,
who came out last winter and who is being
guarded by her mother, her companion, her aunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
and her sophisticated self against the wiles of fortune-hunters
wearing Cupid&#8217;s livery; a son who
was at Groton, is now a sophomore at Harvard;
a daughter nine years old.</p>

<p>They have three fixed and six or seven temporary
residences.</p>

<p>First, there is the palace in Fifth avenue, where
the family is united for a few weeks in each year.
It is closed from the first of June until the first of
October, and when the various members of the
family make flying trips into New York they take
a suite at the St. Regis or at Sherry&#8217;s. Second,
there is &#8220;the cottage&#8221; at Newport, about the same
size as the palace on Fifth avenue. Most of the
family usually spend the latter part of the summer
here. Third, there is the large new house on Long
Island, twenty-five miles from New York, where
several members of the family spend part of the
spring and fall. Luxurious New Yorkers are becoming
more and more susceptible to the changes
of the season. They are emulating, though as yet
at a distance, the smart set of Juvenal&#8217;s Rome, with
its summer and winter finger rings.</p>

<p>Our family have a small house at a fashionable
place in North Carolina; the mother and eldest son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
go there for a part of February and March. They
have a thousand acres and a comfortable house in
the Adirondacks&mdash;the head of the family likes to
shoot and fish. They have a place in the Berkshire
Hills&mdash;but they do not go there now and they are
thinking of selling it. The wife has an apartment
in Paris. She must be sure of comfort when she
goes over for her shopping. Every few years they
take a big house in Mayfair for the season, and
go on to Scotland for the shooting. Then there is
the steam yacht, an ocean greyhound&mdash;last year it
cost them sixty thousand dollars for maintenance,
a few repairs and refittings. The grown son has
persuaded his father to start a racing stable&mdash;a
small one with fifteen or twenty thoroughbreds.
His trainer costs him ten thousand dollars a year,
and his jockey five thousand more, as a retaining
fee. The father estimates the cost of this addition
to the family expense at one hundred thousand
dollars a year&mdash;he hopes this will include betting
losses. The son has long had a string of polo
ponies that costs, with all its embroideries, fifteen
to twenty thousand a year.</p>

<p>Ten years ago this family had only a small house
in town&mdash;small by comparison&mdash;and the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
palace on the Ocean Drive at Newport. But they
do not feel that they are now extravagant. Wherever
they go they find people of their own set and
a good many &#8220;rank outsiders&#8221; doing the same
things they are doing; and they find many doing
things they would think far beyond their means.</p>

<p>For example, a man has just paid two hundred
and eighty thousand dollars for a string of pearls
for his wife. Our multi-millionaire regards that
as an extravagance. He thinks his own wife&#8217;s
string, which cost one hundred and twenty-five
thousand dollars, represents the limit of prudent
expenditure for such a purpose. And those of their
friends whom they regard as comparatively poor&mdash;the
people with from fifty to a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a year&mdash;are pushing them on by
concentrating where they scatter. They meet different
groups of these moderately rich people at
different points in their annual round; and each
group is living almost as well as, in some respects
better than, they are at that particular point. True,
So-and-So&#8217;s house in town is a trivial twenty-room
affair on a side street, but his place in Newport
(he concentrates upon it) is far finer than their
Newport place. Smith is decently housed in town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
and at Newport, but lives in a tiny doll&#8217;s house in
Curzon street during the London season. Jones
is modest in America and England, but how he
does blaze on the Riviera!</p>

<p>There must be no standing still. There must be
progress. The standards, all the standards&mdash;house,
dress, equipage, number and livery of servants,
jewels, works of art, sports, gifts&mdash;are
rising, rising, rising. Each year, more and ever
more must be spent, unless one is to fall behind,
lose one&#8217;s rank, be mingled with the crowd that is
ever pressing on and trying to catch up.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of these plutocrats and
their parasites and imitators, struggling thus desperately
in gaudiness, it is all but impossible not
at times to fear that prosperity, concentrated prosperity,
has killed Democracy, has killed the republic.
Foreigners look at New York and the galaxy
of rich cities eagerly imitating it, and shrug their
shoulders and sneer. Americans look, and try to
keep their courage and their point of view.</p>

<small>PLUTOCRACY AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us glance at our typical Mr. Multi-Millionaire&#8217;s
town house. It is a palace of white
marble, in Fifth avenue, near Fifty-ninth street&mdash;the
view across the Park from the upper windows
is superb. This palace was the inaugural of the
family&#8217;s recent fashionable career. It is the struggle
to live up to it that is making them famous in
New York.</p>

<p>The palace was to have cost our family a million,
including the site. Up to the present time it
has cost them two and a half millions, and that
does not include the one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollar set of tapestries for the dining-room
which is on its way from Europe. The site
cost half a million; the house three-quarters of a
million; the rest went for furniture, and the house
still looks bare to the family. &#8220;A wretched barn,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
madame calls it. There are one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars in paintings and statuary in the
entrance-hall, fifty thousand dollars in paintings,
statuary, and such matters in the rest of the house.
Two hundred thousand dollars could easily be
spent without overcrowding. The furniture, thinly
scattered in the long and lofty salon, cost two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars&mdash;it is amazing how
fast the money disappears once one goes in for old
furniture.</p>

<p>As you look round these show rooms&mdash;the vast
entrance-hall, the enormous dining-room, the great
library, the salon which is used as ballroom, the
comparatively small and exquisitely furnished
reception-rooms&mdash;you are struck by the absence of
individual taste. You are in a true palace&mdash;the
dwelling-place, but in no sense the home, of people
of great wealth, but of no marked &aelig;sthetic development.
They have the money, and to a certain extent
the faculty of appreciation. But others have
supplied the active, the creative brains.</p>

<p>You go up the grand stairway, and at the turn
pause to look down at the magnificent rug which
almost covers the floor of the entrance-hall, up at
the splendid painting which adorns the ceiling.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
The owner&mdash;you know him well&mdash;tells you that
each cost twenty-five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>And then he takes you into the wife&#8217;s living-rooms.
She is out of town.</p>

<p>Madame lives in five great rooms&mdash;a sitting-room,
a dressing-room, a bedroom, a room where
her clothes in use&mdash;quantities of dresses, hats,
wraps, boots, shoes, slippers, drawers full of the
finest underclothing&mdash;are kept, and a bathroom.
She is very crowded, she will tell you. For instance,
where is her secretary to sit and work when
she wishes to use her sitting-room for a private talk
with her son or daughter, or some intimate friend?</p>

<p>You look round these rooms and again you note
the absence of individual taste. Madame is always
on the wing; she has no time to impress herself on
her immediate surroundings. But a very capable
artist has been at work and has not neglected the
opportunities which his freedom in the matter of
money opened to him. He has created several
marvelous color schemes through harmonious shadings
in rugs, upholstery, the brocade coverings of
the walls, the curtains, the woodwork and the ceilings.
You are not surprised that a hundred thousand
dollars went in making suitable surroundings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
for a lady of fashion and fortune. You know that
there are several dozen suites more expensive than
this within gun-shot, and scores almost as expensive
within a radius of half a mile.</p>

<p>If she were at home there would be on that
dressing-table five or six thousand dollars in gold
articles: brushes, combs, hand-mirrors&mdash;each gold
and rock-crystal hand-mirror cost seven hundred
and fifty dollars&mdash;bottles, button-hooks, and so
forth, and so forth. If she were here, there would
be in that safe at least fifty thousand dollars in
jewelry&mdash;a small part of what she has, the rest
being in the safe-deposit vaults.</p>

<p>The two marvels of this suite of hers are the
bed and bath-tub. The bed is on a raised platform
in a sort of alcove. The canopy and curtains are
of a wonderful shade of violet silk. The counter-pane
and roll-cover are of costly lace. The head-board
and foot-board are two splendid paintings&mdash;one
of sleep, the other of awakening. You think
nine thousand dollars was cheap for this bed, even
without canopy, lace and other fineries.</p>

<p>The bath-tub is cut from a solid block of white
marble and is sunk in the marble floor of her
huge bathroom. It is a small swimming-pool,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
and its plumbing is silver, plated with gold. On
the floor of this room at the step down into the tub
there is a great white bear-skin, and there is another
in front of the beautiful little dressing-table.
Three palms rise from the floor and tower&mdash;real
trees&mdash;toward the lofty ceiling.</p>

<p>Going on through the palace you discover that
it is arranged in suites&mdash;somewhat like a very handsome
and exclusive private hotel. And then you
learn that here is not one establishment, but seven,
each separate and distinct. Our multi-millionaire&#8217;s
family have outgrown family life and are living
upon the most aristocratic European plan.</p>

<p>In a smaller, more plainly furnished suite of
rooms than those occupied by his wife, lives the
husband. In a third suite lives the grown son; in
a fourth the grown daughter; in a fifth and sixth,
these the smallest, live the young son and the young
daughter. The seventh establishment consists of
forty-two personal assistants and servants.</p>

<p>Each member of the family has his or her own
sitting-room and there receives callers from within
or without the family&mdash;except that the daughter
receives men callers in the smallest of the three
reception-rooms on the ground floor. Each has his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
or her own personal attendants; each lives his or
her separate social life. They rarely meet at
breakfast&mdash;it is more comfortable to breakfast in one&#8217;s
sitting-room; they rarely meet at luncheon&mdash;luncheon
is the favorite time for going to one&#8217;s intimates;
they rarely meet at dinner&mdash;one or more are sure
to be dining out or the mother is giving a dinner
for married people.</p>

<p>It is with eyes on this lofty height that the New
York family, just emerging from obscure poverty,
with five or six thousand a year, anxiously ask
themselves: &#8220;Now, can we at last afford a man to
go to the door and wait on the table?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the man-servant is the beginning of fashion,
and its height can be measured&mdash;as certainly as in
any other way&mdash;by the number of men-servants
and the splendor of their liveries.</p>

<p>Of course, our family of pacemakers have an
&#8220;adequate&#8221; supply of secretaries, tutors, governesses,
valets, maids; and the housekeeper has her
staff, the chef his, the butler his, the head coachman
his, the captain of the yacht his. Then there are
caretakers, gardeners and farmers, the racing-stable
staff, various and numerous occasional employees.
At the request of Mr. Multi-Millionaire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
his private secretary recently drew up a list of all
persons in the family&#8217;s service. It contained&mdash;with
the yacht out of commission and the Newport place
not yet opened&mdash;seventy-nine names.</p>

<p>Mr. Multi-Millionaire, becoming interested in
statistics, went on to have his secretary take a
census of the horses and carriages owned by the
family. Of horses there were sixty-four, excluding
the seventeen thoroughbreds in the racing stable
at Saratoga, but including the hunters and the polo
ponies. The little girl had the fewest. Poor child!
She had only a pair of ponies and a saddle horse,
and she complained that her sister was always loaning
the hack to some friend whom she wished to
have riding with her. The grown son had the
most&mdash;thirteen; he must hunt and he must coach and
he must play polo, or try to. The father himself
was almost as badly off as his little daughter&mdash;he
had only four.</p>

<p>Of vehicles there were at the town stables a
landau, two large victorias and a small one, two
broughams, a hansom; an omnibus, seating six;
four automobiles, a tandem cart, a pony cart. At
the several country places&mdash;a coach, a drag, a surrey,
a victoria phaeton, two dos-&agrave;-dos, two T-carts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
four runabouts, three buggies, two breaking carts,
making a total of thirty-one.</p>

<p>The secretary remarked that these vehicles, assembled
and properly distanced, would, with their
animals, form a procession about three-quarters of
a mile long. He then tried to read Mr. Multi-Millionaire
some statistics of harness, saddles, and
so forth, but was forbidden.</p>

<p>In further pursuit of this statistical mania, Mr.
Multi-Millionaire discovered that his family and
their friends&mdash;and the servants&mdash;had drunk under
his various roofs during the past year nearly two
thousand quarts of red wine, about one thousand
quarts of champagne, one hundred and fifty quarts
of white wine, one hundred and fifty quarts of
whiskey, one thousand eight hundred quarts of
mineral water, and an amazing amount of brandy,
chartreuse, and so forth. The family&#8217;s total bills
for drink, food, cigars, and cigarettes had been of
such a size that they represented an expenditure of
about three hundred and seventy dollars a day&mdash;about
one hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars
a year. His wife became very angry when he
showed her these last figures. She told him that
he was meddling in her business and that she didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
purpose to spend her whole life in watching servants.</p>

<p>Our multi-millionaire did not make his fortune;
he inherited it. But he has been very shrewd in
managing it, for all his extravagance. Though
he is cautious about expenses in one way, he shows
by the allowances he makes to the various members
of his family that he believes in carrying out
to the uttermost the idea that his family must live
in state. His wife has a million in her own name,
but he makes her an allowance of three hundred
and fifty thousand dollars a year to maintain herself
and their households. The grown son has had
an allowance of twenty-five thousand dollars a year,
and when he marries it will be trebled&mdash;perhaps
quadrupled. This is large for persons of their
modest fortune, but many fathers of smaller means
are doing as much for their children, and our multi-millionaire
will not see his children suffer. His
grown daughter has an allowance of fifteen thousand
dollars&mdash;more than she needs, as she has only
to buy her clothes and pay her small expenses out
of it. The boy in college has five thousand dollars
a year; he is always in debt, but his mother helps
him. The youngest child has ten dollars a week&mdash;her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
clothes are bought for her, and she can always
get money from her father or mother when she
wishes to make handsome presents.</p>

<p>The most interesting person in the family is the
mother. She is its moving force, one of the moving
forces in the extravagant life of New York City
to-day. You see her name and her pictures in the
newspapers very often, always in connection with
the news that she is doing something. She was
the first in New York to have huge flunkeys in
gaudy knee-breeches and silk stockings in waiting
at her front door. She was the first to have as an
entertainment for a few people after dinner several
of the grand opera stars and the finest orchestra in
the country. She is a woman with ideas&mdash;ideas
for new and not noisy or gaudy, but attractive ostentations
of luxury. She spends money recklessly,
but she gets what she wants.</p>

<p>She is one of the busiest women in town. And
the main part of her business is one which engages
New York women, and men, too, ever more and
more&mdash;the fight for prolonging youth.</p>

<p>You would never suspect that she is the mother
of a son twenty-five years old. Indeed, you would
not suspect from her looks or her conversation that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
she is a mother. She is making her fight for youth
most successfully. Of course, she uses no artifices&mdash;the
New York women who care greatly about
looks have long since abandoned artificiality, except
as a fad. Her hair is thick and dark and fine. It
is her own, kept vigorous by constant treatment.
Her skin is clear and smooth and healthily pale&mdash;it
costs her and her beauty assistants hours of labor
to keep it thus. Her figure is tall and slender and
girlish&mdash;her masseuse could tell you how that is
done. She lives, eats, exercises, with the greatest
regularity. And she eats little and drinks less.</p>

<p>On dress she spends about fifty-five thousand
dollars a year. You will not see her many times
in the same hat or dress; and she has a passion for
real lace underclothing and for those stockings
which seem to have been woven on fairy looms of
some substance so unsubstantial that only fairies
could handle it. She bought twelve thousand dollars&#8217;
worth of underclothing when she was in Paris
last spring. Her bills at the dressmaker&#8217;s of the
Rue de la Paix were twenty-seven thousand dollars,
and at the milliner&#8217;s twenty-four hundred dollars.
She has about five thousand dollars invested in
parasols. She has sixty-seven thousand dollars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>&#8217;
worth of wraps&mdash;sables, chinchillas and ermine
cannot be got for small sums. She has many evening
dresses that cost from eight hundred dollars to
twelve hundred dollars each. She has few dresses
that cost as little as one hundred and twenty-five
dollars. The average price for her hats would
be, perhaps, fifty dollars. She had one with fur on
it last winter that cost two hundred and seventy-five
dollars.</p>

<p>The chief reason for her large expenditure for
clothes is that now-a-days every detail of each costume
must be in harmony. She must have slippers,
stockings, skirt, dress, hat, parasol, all to match or
in perfect harmony. For she is one of half a dozen
New York women who are famous for style, and
having established this reputation she must live up
to it. When she ceases to fight for youth&mdash;which
will be in about ten years&mdash;she will probably cut
her expenditures for dress in half. By that time
extravagance will have so far advanced that her
successor will spend seventy-five thousand dollars
or more on dress. The last season has seen a three-league
advance. It is now the fashion to wear for
a drive down the Avenue those delicate shades
which are ruined so quickly. Next season the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
color scheme of the Avenue will be still more gorgeous
and varied&mdash;and prodigiously more expensive.</p>

<p>But it is her mode of keeping house and entertaining
that makes the thousands and tens of thousands
fly. Her establishments are maintained like
so many luxurious hotel restaurants. Though her
housekeeper is a capable person and she herself
studies her accounts closely, it is impossible to be
ready at all times to house and feed an indefinite
number of people of exacting taste without spending
great sums of money. It costs to be able to
say to the butler at the last moment: &#8220;There will
be ten for luncheon, instead of six,&#8221; or &#8220;There will
be twelve for dinner, instead of four,&#8221; or &#8220;There
will be four for dinner, not eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our Mrs. Multi-Millionaire lives no better in
respect of her table than scores of people in her set
and around it. She pays her chef one hundred
dollars a month and her butler seventy-five dollars
a month, and so do they. She has no better supplies
on hand than have they. Her bills at the
shops where they sell things out of season&mdash;peaches
at four dollars apiece, strawberries at fifty cents
apiece, and peas at a dollar a small measure&mdash;show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
no different kinds of items from theirs. They, too,
have S&egrave;vres plates at five hundred dollars the
dozen. They, too, have fruit plates and finger-bowls
of gold plated on silver that cost twelve hundred
dollars the dozen. They, too, have solid-gold
after-dinner coffee cups at two thousand dollars
the dozen, and solid-gold spoons at four hundred
dollars the dozen. The difference between
the dinners of those of her fortune and the dinners
of those of fewer millions lies in quantity, not quality.
Where they would have to make an effort in
arranging an unusual dinner and could not have
more than a dozen at table, her establishment
and many more establishments like hers would easily
and without effort expand to entertain, in a
fashion once called royal, two or three scores of
guests.</p>

<p>The main and very conspicuous characteristic of
this typical leader in New York&#8217;s extravagance is,
naturally, restlessness. Like the other women of
her set, like their imitators, down and down
through the strata of New York&#8217;s wealth-scaled society,
she wanders nervously about, spending
money, inventing new ways of spending it, all because
she is in search of something, she knows not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
what, that ever eludes her. And this restlessness,
this nervousness, this hysteria, possesses the women
and the men alike. Does it come uptown with the
men from Wall street? Does it go downtown from
the women and the fever of Fifth avenue? It is
impossible to say. We only know that it possesses
both and that it influences their every relation of
life, public and private.</p>

<p>A fashionable woman sails for Europe&mdash;more
than five thousand dollars&#8217; worth of flowers, jewels,
books, things to eat and drink, go to the steamer
on sailing day from her friends. A young couple
are married&mdash;their intimates and relatives give
them three-quarters of a million in wedding gifts.
A brother meets his sister on her way downstairs
on the morning of her birthday&mdash;&#8220;Here is a little
gift for you,&#8221; he says, pausing just long enough
to hand her a paper. It makes her the owner of
a million in gilt-edged securities. A husband comes
home from the office&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve put through my deal,&#8221;
he says. &#8220;You can have your new house, but I
won&#8217;t stand for more than a million and a
half.&#8221; A father calls his son into his study
and says, &#8220;You will be twenty-one to-morrow. I
fix your allowance at seventy-five thousand dollars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
a year.&#8221; A doctor goes to a banker to get a
small subscription for a new hospital&mdash;&#8220;Why not
build a new hospital?&#8221; asks the banker. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give a million. If that&#8217;s not enough I&#8217;ll give
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is amazing how many great and beautiful
palaces of a kind such as is occupied by our multi-millionaire
are being added yearly to New York&#8217;s
fashionable quarter. And there is not a single
palace in New York that is comfortable. No way
has yet been devised for making them otherwise
than chilly and draughty. The human animal is
too small for such huge surroundings; and there
are not enough competent servants or even competent
available housekeepers to make the domestic
machinery run smoothly.</p>

<p>The new millionaires slip into New York, into
their new palaces, attracting little attention. Men
with a scant million or two are coming all the time
unobserved. If it were not necessity that drove
them here, many of them would doubtless become
angry at their insignificance and would go where
less money gives distinction. But the rapid concentration
of the directing forces of the business
of the country in Manhattan Island compels them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
to yield to the entreaties of their wives and daughters
and remain.</p>

<p>Scores of these palace owners have or seem to
have no way of getting acquainted with anybody
whatsoever. There are millionaires&#8217; families that
stare drearily out of the windows, bored to death
in their isolation, and wishing they were back in
the Western town where they used to have lots of
fun. There are others who give entertainments in
the vast rooms of their palaces at which you will
find their clerks, a few nondescripts male and female,
and no others&mdash;these standing or strolling
awkwardly about, trying to forget that they are
miserable in reflecting on the cost of the pictures
and the decorations.</p>

<p>In the surroundings above outlined, how could
anyone, whether newly rich or long rich, lead other
than a sordid life? Money is there necessarily the
basis of all action, the determiner of the complexion
of every thought.</p>

<p>To the narrow vision of the palace dweller and
of those who look only at palace dwellers, America
seems like a greedy, ill-mannered child released
upon a candy shop. In the wide, the true aspect it
seems a man, intelligently developing himself, fevered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
by a sense of the shortness of life and the vastness
of its opportunities.</p>

<p>In the one aspect it suggests an express rushing
along, with the engineer mad and the passengers
drunk. In the other aspect it suggests its own
miraculous sky-scrapers, rising swift as an exhalation,
high as the clouds, yet securely founded upon
the rock.</p>

<small>YOUTH AMONG THE MONEY-MANIACS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> typical young men of the America of fashion
and high finance, created by the multi-millionaire,
fall into two classes&mdash;the born successes, sons
or heirs of rich men; the candidates for success. It
is hardly necessary to say that in this connection
success always means the accumulation of riches
enough to enable one to make a stir even among the
very rich.</p>

<p>If the young man is a born success, all that is left
for him to achieve is to devise some plan for making
a stir&mdash;the simplest way being to marry some
woman with a talent for doing original and striking
things. No matter how great his income, if he is
not to suffer the fate of being an obscure follower,
a merely rich person, suspected of stinginess, stupidity
and vulgarity to boot, he must do something
out of the ordinary&mdash;assemble an astonishing establishment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
have the finest pictures, give the finest
dinners and dances, run the fastest horses or the
most demoniac automobile, give large sums on some
original plan to education and philanthropy.</p>

<p>The chances are that the born success will marry
in his own set&mdash;that is, the daughter or the heiress
of some rich man. This will be due in large part
to deliberation; also, neither is likely to know well
many people who are not rich or of the rich.
If he is the eldest son, the probabilities, the increasing
probabilities are that he will inherit the
bulk of the fortune, no matter how many brothers
and sisters he may have. Some one in the next
generation must maintain the family magnificence.
Naturally, therefore, an unwritten law of primogeniture
is rapidly growing in force and effect.</p>

<p>And this custom, combined with the rapidity
with which great wealth piles up in America for
him who has great commercial skill, insures us a
future of ever more dazzling splendor, of luxury
and extravagance&mdash;an <i>immediate</i> future; we will
not here speculate as to that future which is more
remote, but not less certain.</p>

<p>A short time ago a young man&mdash;a &#8220;born success&#8221;&mdash;went
to a beautiful country house near New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
York to make a Saturday-to-Monday visit. He
brought with him two huge trunks. These were
taken to the almost magnificent suite of rooms
which had been assigned to him. His valet unlocked
the trunks and summoned the chambermaid.
The two servants stripped from the bed the sheets
and pillow-cases and covers; then from the trunks
they took the young man&#8217;s own wonderful bed-clothing,
woven especially for him by the best looms
in Europe. These creations were put on the bed
in place of the silk and fine linen which the owner
of the country house, a very rich man, regarded
as fit for a king, but which this young man thought
far too coarse for contact with his delicate skin.</p>

<p>The host was given to extravagance, was used
to and in sympathy with the eccentric efforts of too-rich
people to attract attention to themselves. But
this insulting refinement &#8220;got&#8221; on his nerves. As
his guest was a very rich man, and was therefore
entitled to that reverential deference which only
the rich are capable of feeling for and giving to
the rich, the host let no outward sign of his state
of mind appear. But he confided the insult to his
other guests as a &#8220;joke,&#8221; and had them privately
laughing and jeering at his young friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>This young man is one of the small advance
guard of the new generation of plutocrats&mdash;the
generation that has about the same knowledge of
life as it is lived by the great mass of Americans
that we have of the mode of life in a Hottentot
kraal. We shall soon be far better acquainted with
these sons and grandsons of somebodies than we
are at present. Soon the wealth and industrial
energy of the country will be controlled by them,
or, rather, through them by a clever and unscrupulous
few. Let us therefore pause for a moment
upon these American &#8220;born successes,&#8221; taking at
random some one of them as a type&mdash;one we will
call, for convenience, Jones.</p>

<p>His father was a great business man, and in
forty years of intelligent, incessant and unscrupulous
effort amassed a vast fortune so invested that
it gave the possessor control of an enormous
financial and industrial area. The father was a
self-made man; he had a profound reverence for
book-learning; he was resolved that none of his
own deficiencies should be reproduced in his son.
His boy was to be a &#8220;cultured gentleman,&#8221; moving
in the &#8220;best society.&#8221; Also, the boy should have all
the &#8220;fun&#8221; which first poverty and then business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
cares had denied to the old man. He sent young
Jones to the most famous schools both here and
abroad; and he gave him plenty of money. It is
not definitely known whether the old man was
proud of the results of his method of bringing up
a boy so far as he saw them before he died; but
there is reason to believe that he was. Certainly,
the boy was as different as it is possible to imagine
from his plain, rather coarse, very manly if also
very unscrupulous father. The boy had all his
father&#8217;s supreme contempt for the ordinary moral
code and for the mass of &#8220;weaklings&#8221; who live
under it and suffer themselves to be plucked.
There the resemblance between the two ends. In
place of a brain, the boy acquired at college and
elsewhere a lump of vanities, affectations and poses.
Surrounded by hirelings from infancy, he became
convinced that he was the handsomest in body and
the most brilliant in mind that the world had in
recent centuries produced. He thought, having
been assured of it by shopkeepers and agents, that
his taste was almost too fine for a coarse, commercial
era, that his nerves were almost too delicate
even for the works of the greatest musicians and
painters and sculptors and poets, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
living both within and without a sort of tone-poem.</p>

<p>When he came into his own and descended to
Wall street, he was gratified but not surprised to
learn that Wall street entertained his own exalted
opinion of himself. And when he heard on every
side that, in addition to being such an exquisite as a
Lucullus or a Louis XIV would have copied, he
was the greatest financier that ever lived, a boy-wonder
at high finance, a greater than his father,
the brain of a Nathan Rothschild in the body of
a young Apollo, he accepted it all as the matter-of-course.
Like so many of our very rich, he had
an economical streak in him&mdash;but this was a profound
secret, hardly known even to himself. So,
he readily fell in with Wall street&#8217;s pleasant way
of saving its own money and living off the money
of other people. He plunged into the wildest extravagances,
imitating and striving to outdo the
young scions of plutocracy with whom he associated
uptown. And like them, he made the people of
whose trust funds his wealth gave him control, pay
the bills. It is vulgar to pay one&#8217;s own bills, but
there is no objection to their being paid out of
another&#8217;s pocket. It saves one from the degradation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
of counting the cost, of thinking about prices
and limits of incomes and such low things.</p>

<p>No sooner was he fairly launched than a half
dozen of the great plutocrats, with wild shouts of
adulation, proclaimed him their leader, put him in
a commanding position in all their big swindling
schemes called &#8220;finance&#8221; in Wall street. &#8220;You&#8217;re
it, my lad,&#8221; they cried. &#8220;We take a back seat. Go
up front where you belong. We&#8217;ll do whatever
you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is it strange that the young man went about as if
he were Mercury of the winged feet? Is it strange
that he got into the habit of greeting his fellow-men
with that gracious sweetness which kings alone
have&mdash;and they only on the stage or in novels?
And when it is added that uptown the married
women flattered him, all the girls languished upon
him, everybody pronounced him a devil of a fellow,
a heart-breaker, a real, twenty-four carat, all-wool
&#8220;cuss,&#8221; is it not wonderful that he did not go quite
mad and dress in purple and wear laces and a
sword?</p>

<p>Indeed, he did have those moments of absolute
mental aberration, and had to go to or give fancy
balls to hide his lunacy from the world. At those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
balls he always dressed in some ancient kingly costume;
and so evident was it that he thought himself
indeed a king, holding a grand levee, that a smirk
followed in his wake as he stepped grandly about&mdash;a
smirk that burst into a titter as soon as he was
out of ear-shot. Yet really he was not the least bit
more ridiculous than the other sons and daughters
of plutocracy, all dressed up as kings and queens
and nobles and grandees, and wondering if the
imaginary were not the real and their moments in
ordinary clothes a nightmare.</p>

<p>On and on he went, madder and madder, so
crazy about himself that even his plutocratic &#8220;lieutenants,&#8221;
who were using him as a stool-pigeon,
could hardly keep their faces straight. At last he
got to the stage at which the old kings of France
got just before the Revolution&mdash;the mental state
superinduced by beginning their education by setting
in their copy-books as a writing model, &#8220;Kings
may do whatever they please.&#8221; He never had had
any sense of trusteeship; he had been flattered into
believing that the railway or manufactory in which
he owned a large amount of stock was his very
own, that wages and salaries paid and dividends
declared were his royal and gracious largess. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
he at first had a dim sense that this great truth
must not be publicly aired, that it was prudent to let
the common people believe they had some share in
the enterprise. Now, however, this dim respect
for, or, rather, tolerance of, a popular delusion
vanished. With rolling eyes and haughty nose
and lips and high-stepping legs he advanced boldly
and publicly into his kingdom. A Russian grand-duke
said of the Russian people, &#8220;These fleas
imagine they are the dog.&#8221; Young Jones said in
effect the same thing of the depositors and stockholders
in &#8220;my&#8221; enterprises, and showed publicly
that he thought it.</p>

<p>Great excitement. His plutocrat &#8220;lieutenants,&#8221;
seeing that their graft through this joyous young
ass was imperiled, tried to quiet him. Failing
there, they tried to cajole, then to cow the insurgent
&#8220;fleas.&#8221; But all in vain. The ears of Jones,
attuned only to adulatory sounds, were assailed by
such shuddering rudenesses as &#8220;Petty larceny thief!
Jackass! Swindler! Puller-in for the big gamblers!
Crazy numskull!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frightful, wasn&#8217;t it? Not that he was in the
least disturbed in his own exalted opinion of himself.
An angel come from heaven direct would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
have moved him only to light, incredulous laughter
by telling him the plain truth about himself. Still,
the clamor was unpleasant; the open sneers, the sly
stabs. And, above all, the ingratitude! The ingratitude
of his associates in &#8220;society&#8221; who had
got so much expensive entertainment and so much
inspiration from him. The ingratitude of the
people, his vassals, whom he paid salaries and
wages and dividends, whom he permitted to deposit
in his banks and to invest in his enterprises!</p>

<p>His soul is brave, as becomes the soul porphyrogenetic.
But, as it is also a sensitive soul, how it is
wrung!</p>

<p>The trouble with our young Jones is that he was
premature&mdash;not in thought, but in showing his
thoughts. Only premature. The madness that
ravaged him is in the plutocratic air. Many eyes
are rolling, many fingers are twitching in the
premonitory symptoms of the malady. A few
years at our plutocracy&#8217;s present rate of progress,
and Jones will be recognized as a martyr. &#8220;Jones
was born a little too soon. Jones came to a climax
a little before the season,&#8221; the dandies will say.</p>

<p>June is the time for roses. Jones came in April.
Poor Jones! Poor April rose!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>Such is the mode of the &#8220;born success&#8221;; now
for the young man who is born with brains and
appetites and ambitions only. He is determined
to achieve a plutocratic success; looks about him for
the road that leads to palaces, equipages, yachts&mdash;all
that gives one title to a seat at the table of honor
at this banquet of extravagant luxury. He sees
at once that to become a multi-millionaire he must
use his brains to force or to cajole the multi-millionaires
to make him one of them.</p>

<p>He must pattern after those who are far on the
way to achieving his kind of success: this corporation
lawyer earning his hundred thousand or more
a year as the legal servant of rich men; that railway
president with his fifty thousand a year and
perquisites, earned as the commercial servant of
rich men; that manager getting a salary of one
hundred and twenty-five thousand as a seeker of
safe investments for surplus millions of income&mdash;again
a servant of rich men; that bank president
with salary and opportunities together netting him
upward of two hundred thousand a year&mdash;again
a servant of the rich; that broker who put by half
a million last year as a result of his skill and assiduity
in the service of rich operators; that doctor who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
made seventy-five thousand in fees and two hundred
thousand in Wall Street last year on &#8220;tips&#8221;
from grateful patients&mdash;again the rewards of service
to the rich.</p>

<p>Our young candidate for success has brains to
sell; he wants customers with money. He hopes
ultimately to sell these brains at a very high price;
he wants customers with lots of money, millions
of money, in which he may presently share largely.
He must ingratiate himself with the rich; must go
where they are to be found, not only in business
hours, but also in hours of relaxation. He must
not only work hard; he must also play hard and
high&mdash;must lead the life of the rich as far as possible.
His air, his dress, his style of living, all
must be such that he will be regarded as rich and
progressive. To drudge and to economize and to
keep away from the extravagance downtown and
up will mean a small success, or at best one that
will not lead to the lofty height of fashion and
social position upon which he has fixed his eyes.</p>

<p>He may have a streak of incurable folly in him.
His effort to be &#8220;a man of the world&#8221; may draw
him from discreet dissipation into that vortex which
swallows up all weaklings not secured by great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
wealth. But let us suppose that he is not a weakling
and that he keeps clearly in mind that at the
basis of all success lies clear-headed, incessant industry.
He works steadily at his business, commercial
or professional; he shows capacity and is
advanced; he is soon getting four or five thousand
a year. At the same time he has prospered in what
may be called the uptown end of his business; he
has made acquaintances among the rich socially;
several women of importance are interested in him
and are telling their husbands and their husbands&#8217;
friends that he has brains. The men are seeing
that the women are not mistaken.</p>

<p>In any American city except New York or Chicago,
our young man would now be regarded as a
person of some consequence. In New York or
Chicago he has merely reached the point at which
he can, if he is sagacious, measure his insignificance.
He has worked hard, but the real day&#8217;s toil has
only begun. He has raised himself from the class
that includes hundreds of thousands; but he is still
in a class that includes tens of thousands.</p>

<p>Perhaps this discourages him, makes him feel
that he can never attain the paradise of multi-millionaires,
or that, if he did attain it, he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
be too exhausted to enjoy it. Perhaps experience
has given him a clearer insight into the real meaning
of his ambitions, and he is disgusted with their
pettiness and sordidness, and begins to long for
self-respect and decency and manhood. Perhaps his
dream of success has been interrupted by a dream
of sentiment. He may decide to marry and settle
down&mdash;he has found New York drearily cold and
lonely.</p>

<p>In that event he gives up his bachelor apartments
in the edge of the fashionable district; he is seen
no more at his club&mdash;indeed, he has resigned from
it; he is forgotten by his fashionable friends; he
and his wife live obscurely in a flat or an apartment
hotel far from the world of fashion, or in a
cottage down in the country&mdash;a commuter&#8217;s cottage,
as unlike as possible the multi-millionaire&#8217;s
cottage of marble or limestone, of which he once
dreamed. And as he is no longer of the world
with which we are concerned, he drops out of sight&mdash;for
the present.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, perhaps his discovery of
his insignificance does not discourage him, but only
serves to rouse him to greater efforts. His close
inspection of the palaces and performances of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
fashionable and extravagant rich has fired his
imagination and energy. In that case he does not
marry. &#8220;I am too poor,&#8221; he says, as he looks at
his paltry income of five thousand a year and thinks
on the humble m&eacute;nage it would maintain, and remembers
that his poorest married acquaintances up
in the Fifth avenue or Lake Drive district have fifteen
thousand a year and cannot afford to entertain
or to keep a carriage, and are always fretting about
money. He considers what a &#8220;decent&#8221; hat or dress
for a woman costs, and&mdash;well, his tailor&#8217;s bill was
seven hundred dollars last year and he has almost
no clothes. He remembers his bills for the few
small and very modest dinners he gave&mdash;a week&#8217;s
earnings gone in a few minutes and the dinner
a poor affair beside the poorest he has had at the
houses of his rich acquaintances. To console himself
for his heroic sacrifice of sentiment to ambition,
he takes a somewhat better apartment for his
bachelor self in a more fashionable apartment
house&mdash;his rent is twelve hundred a year. He
works hard downtown; he continues to work hard
uptown. He works as cleverly in the one quarter
as in the other. He is always seen with rich people;
he belongs to fashionable clubs; he dines in palaces;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
he goes for Saturday-to-Monday visits at great, extravagantly
maintained country houses; he is seen
in boxes at the opera, at the horse show; he expands
his tastes and his expenditures with his rapidly expanding
income. His &#8220;fixed charges&#8221; are now
fifteen thousand a year&mdash;very moderate for a man
of his associations.</p>

<p>In addition to these absolute necessities he spends
about fifteen thousand more upon presents and entertaining.
Half a dozen men living in the apartment
house he lives in spend twice as much as he
does and do not consider themselves, and are not
considered, either extravagant or dissipated.</p>

<p>He is making a great deal of money, but he feels&mdash;and
is&mdash;poor. However, he is sustained and
soothed by the certainty of riches immediately
ahead. He has been spending, but it has been in
the nature of an investment&mdash;a most judicious investment
from the standpoint of his purposes. And
presently his cleverness and audacity and &#8220;large
ideas&#8221; have their reward; and then he marries.</p>

<p>She has tastes which are exactly his. She is
willing to marry him because she has not made the
success she and her mother dreamed of and strove
for. She has some money&mdash;their joint income,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
while not imposing as New York incomes go, is
still large enough to enable them to make &#8220;a decent
start in life,&#8221; as their &#8220;set&#8221; interprets life.</p>

<p>Presently we find them installed in a &#8220;small&#8221;
house or &#8220;little&#8221; apartment&mdash;the rent is more than
ten thousand a year, and they have twelve servants.
His skill as a money-maker is talked about; her
dresses are admired and envied; their equipages,
their surroundings, their dinners are models of luxurious
good taste. As both are shrewd managers,
their forty thousand a year enables them to seem
to be spending twice that amount. They are in the
high-road of plutocratic happiness and are creditably
charioted. And as the years pass, their increasing
wealth rolls up on itself as large wealth
has a habit of doing. They annually tour the multi-millionaire
circuit in great state&mdash;North Carolina,
Hempstead, the Hudson, London, Paris, Newport.
They have children.</p>

<p>No healthier, rosier, more intelligent children
can be found anywhere than theirs. They have the
best care that competent nurses and governesses can
give. They live by the clock, are fed the most
expensive and at the same time the most sensible
food. They are dressed in a manner that makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
plain mothers blink and stare. There are only two
of them and the elder is only seven, but their
clothing bill last year was fourteen hundred. It
will be less, much less, as they grow older, for it
is not good form to dress boys and girls
extravagantly&mdash;at least not yet. They speak French and
German as fluently as they speak English, and far
more correctly. They have everything for mind
and body&mdash;except the direct constant care of their
mother. They have everything&mdash;that money can
buy.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the cross-roads and take a candidate
for success who, when he achieved his modest
five thousand a year, married and went to live
in a flat or small suite in an apartment hotel of the
kind that would have been called luxurious a dozen
years ago, but is now third-class. Let us assume
that his wife, whether she came from out-of-town
or from the city, is the typical present-day big-city
woman of extravagant ideas&mdash;is, like her husband,
wealth-crazy and luxury-crazy and society-mad.</p>

<p>In all probability they will have no children.
Children are not popular among the extravagant in
New York&mdash;dogs are less expensive, less troublesome,
fully as affectionate and far less unfashionable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
The extravagant rich still tolerate children,
possibly because of a quaint, made-in-England
theory that aristocratic families should maintain
the &#8220;family line.&#8221; But &#8220;climbers&#8221; cannot afford the
necessary time and money. It was Swift&mdash;was it
not?&mdash;who first called attention to the fact that the
attitude in climbing and in crawling is the same.</p>

<p>Our young climber is busy all day downtown&mdash;busy
making money. His wife is busy uptown&mdash;busy
spending the money he makes, or as much of
it as she can threaten or wheedle away from him.
She falls into a set of young married women with
husbands and tastes like hers. They, like their
husbands, think only of wealth and extravagance.
And while they wait for their dreams to come true
they invest every cent they can lay their hands upon
in an imitative vain show.</p>

<p>Our young man&#8217;s wife reads the fashionable intelligence
with her coffee. She presently goes forth
as fashionably dressed as if their income were three
or four times what it is. She walks in fashionable
streets or sits in some fashionable restaurant, there
to view and study and envy the fashionable women
she reads about. She &#8220;shops&#8221; in the fashionable
millinery and dressmaking establishments&mdash;not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
buy, but to steal hints for the use of her own
cheaper milliner and dressmaker in getting together
her imitation costumes. She strives to model her
person, her dress, her walk, her conduct, her conversation
upon the conception of what is fashionable
in the multi-millionaire&#8217;s set.</p>

<p>As our young man has the genius for money-getting,
he gradually becomes rich. As his wealth
grows he and his wife &#8220;drop&#8221; the &#8220;friends&#8221; of less
income, gather about them &#8220;friends&#8221; of their own
fortune, and reach out for &#8220;friends&#8221; who have fortunes
greater than their own. And at last, perhaps
by way of a season in London under the guidance
of some impecunious woman of title, they arrive at
the bliss of being able to tour the multi-millionaire&#8217;s
circuit in good company all the way. And a crowd
gapes at their palace doors and windows whenever
they &#8220;entertain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those city crowds that pause to gape whenever
more than one carriage halts before a palace!</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago the most extravagant millionaire
in New York&mdash;a great financier&mdash;spent upon
his domestic establishment, everything included,
eighty thousand a year. Very few people of his
set spent half as much, and the most of them spent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
less than twenty-five thousand. To-day, for the
fashionable extravagant set, eighty thousand a year
would not be far from the average expenditure,
taking rich and &#8220;poor&#8221; together. When that financier&#8217;s
family were the leaders, the principal entertainments
in fashionable society were modest affairs&mdash;though
they were not then regarded as economical&mdash;and
were given by association. To-day every
palace has its great dining-hall and its huge ballroom.
And the very rich who have not palaces give
their big entertainments individually in hotels and
restaurants, hiring a large part of the building for
the exclusive use of their guests, and spending thirty
or forty thousand dollars or more&mdash;in not a few
instances far more&mdash;upon each entertainment.</p>

<p>To-morrow&mdash;</p>

<p>In this early twentieth century&mdash;which bids fair
to be known as America&#8217;s century&mdash;New York,
the capital of our plutocracy, blazes out a world-capital.
Into it are pouring wealth and luxury,
pictures, statuary and works of art of all kinds and
periods; jewels and collections of rarities. In it
are rising miles on miles of palaces, wonderful
parks and driveways. It has begun to be a City
Splendid. It has already won a place in the line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
of world-capitals back and back through the ages
to the mighty, nameless, forgotten cities of the
Valley of the Euphrates. And New York begins
where the others reached their climax.</p>

<small>CASTE-COMPELLERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is still an open and anxious question whether
this fashionable society, the growth, as we have
seen, of the last two or three decades, constitutes
a genuine aristocracy. The society itself hopes so
and tries to believe so, and struggles to forget its
uncertain tenure, its sordid basis and its humble
ancestry. And it is encouraged in its pretensions
by many thousands of agile and aggressive climbers
who would not for worlds lose their delusion that
their climbing has a goal, and a goal worth achieving.
But uneasy doubts refuse to down, and whenever
one of the fashionables says, with a brave
essay at the careless, matter-of-course tone, &#8220;We of
the upper classes,&#8221; he&mdash;or she, for it is more often
she&mdash;can&#8217;t refrain from a furtive glance to see
whether all faces within sight are perfectly sober,
self-complacent and approving.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>No such uncertainty, however, exists in the case
of the servants of wealth and fashion. They know
that they themselves are an aristocracy, and they
are determined that there shall be no doubt about
their being dignified, if menial, bulwarks of an
aristocracy of their employers. These servants,
both male and female, are not Americans. Once
in a while you will find among them a naturalized
American; once in a long while you will find a
shamefaced, apologetic American-born. But they
are essentially an immigrant aristocracy, and nine-tenths
of them are from England, where the iron
caste-distinctions of feudalism have come down
even unto the present day, not only merely intact,
but monstrously exaggerated, where snobbishness
is not only part of the statute law, but deeply imbedded
in the vastly more potent customary law,
and is even incorporated in the divine law, is read
out from the pulpit each Sunday and piously echoed
by reverent congregations.</p>

<p>In Europe the &#8220;upper class&#8221; and its haughty
servants are born to their lofty stations; here the
&#8220;upper class&#8221; is manufactured, largely out of watered
stock and bonds and stolen franchises, and its
servants are imported. It is the natural instinct of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
small people, suddenly elevated in material wealth,
to try to believe that the wealth which relieves them
of the necessity for daily labor also produces a
chemical change, a refining transformation, in the
clay whereof their singularly human-looking bodies
are composed. Against this instinct is the good old
American sense of humor that recognizes in the
unerasable physical and mental mint-marks of human
brotherhood Nature&#8217;s mocking rebuke to the
vanities of pose and pretense. But few people&#8217;s
sense of humor extends to themselves; and if they
get the least encouragement, off they go on a high
horse. Our rich people get more than a little encouragement
from certain of their fellow-citizens
and from upper-class foreigners, who for obvious
reasons cultivate and flatter them in the delusion
that it is not their bank accounts but themselves
that are superior. But the fashionable section
would never have gone so fast or so far in this
hallucination had it not been for this important
menial aristocracy. Students of human development,
in their passion for dealing only with the
seemingly big, with the high-sounding, often reach
conclusions ludicrously wide of the truth, often
neglect those humble but mighty causes that really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
shape human destiny. They find in the great and
burning thoughts of philosophers the explanations
of revolutions which a glance at the prices of bread
would more justly explain. Let us make no such
mistake. In seeking the cause of our rich people&#8217;s
sudden and furious craze for caste let us not be
proud. Let us turn away from the bronze front
doors and the magnificent drawing-room and go
humbly to the area gate and the backstairs quarters,
where the real cause of their curious, amusing and
pitiful backsliding from the grand concepts of Democracy
is to be found.</p>

<p>When rich Americans first began to go abroad
the servility of English servants offended. But
custom soon changed that. Servility is insidious.
The Americans, longing to feel themselves the
equals of the complacent and secure upper class in
England, and realizing that they could never hope
to get deferential respect from their fellow-countrymen&mdash;even
from those willing to go into domestic
service&mdash;began to import servants. &#8220;The
English servants are so much better, you know;
understand their business and their place.&#8221; But the
English servant&#8217;s &#8220;place&#8221; in the social hierarchy
is dependent upon his master&#8217;s place. Whoever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
seeks to lower the master in the social scale seeks
to lower the servant. On the other hand, whatever
raises the master socially raises the servant. Your
Englishman who is a servant born and bred is even
more incapable of understanding and warming up
to Democracy than his king would be. He loathes
Democracy&mdash;does it not lower him in the social
scale by putting all men on the same level; does it
not take away his dear gods of rank and birth and
leave him godless and adrift? He wants none of
it. It may be good enough for foreigners, but not
for an Englishman.</p>

<p>Once the imported members of the servile aristocracy
were among us in considerable numbers
they began to plot and to compel an aristocracy
above them. The general theory is that these rich
Americans who have gone crazy about themselves
were infected by associating with the aristocracies
of the Old World, and no doubt that association is
partly responsible. But the main cause of the malady
is that every American family living ostentatiously,
or even at all luxuriously, soon found established
within its gates an aristocracy of caste that
compelled the family to seem to put on airs. And
any American family that assembles a household<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
staff of these aristocrats will soon be strutting and
posing, however hard it may strive to remain sensible.
The servants simply won&#8217;t have &#8220;under-bred&#8221;
Democracy; they would despise themselves if they
found themselves working for men and women
not their superiors. And it isn&#8217;t in human nature,
weakened by the example of all around it, to resist
the subtle and insinuating compulsion of the &#8220;well-bred&#8221;
hints and innuendos of &#8220;well-bred&#8221; servants.
A man and a woman are no longer master and mistress
of themselves, not to speak of their house,
when they have given way to the luxury and
vanity of a real high-class English butler backed
up by half a dozen English footmen, an English
coachman and three or four English grooms. He
and she will begin to cut pigeon-wings like a colored
gentleman on the first warm day of Spring. He
and she will do it because the servants expect it,
because the servants have convinced them that it is
the correct form, because the servants will not tolerate
any departure from the pose of &#8220;my lord&#8221;
and &#8220;my lady&#8221;&mdash;and because such posings are so
titillating to the vanity. And from striving to seem
a truly &#8220;my lord&#8221; and a truly &#8220;my lady&#8221; before
the &#8220;well-bred&#8221; butler and coachman and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
henchmen, the man and the woman pass on naturally
and by imperceptible stages to making the
same ludicrous struggle in all seriousness before
their associates, all of whom are doing precisely the
same silly thing from precisely the same silly cause.</p>

<p>There is a woman in one of our big cities who is
now a leader of fashion, very &#8220;classy&#8221; indeed, most
glib on the subject of the &#8220;traditions of people of
our station.&#8221; Her father was an excellent peddler,
her mother a farmer&#8217;s daughter who could be induced
to &#8220;help out&#8221; a neighbor in the rush of the
harvest time. This typical American woman behaved
very sensibly so long as her sensible father
and mother were alive and until the craze for English
households arose. She fell in line. But the
haughty servants were most trying at first. For
instance, she loved bread spread with molasses.
She ate it before the butler once; his face told her
what a hideous &#8220;break&#8221; she had made. She tried
to conquer this low taste&mdash;never did weak woman
fight harder against the gnawings of sinful appetite.
At last she gave way, and in secret and in
stealth indulged. She was not caught and, encouraged,
she proceeded to add one low common habit
to another until she was leading a double life. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
had its terrors; it had its compensating joys. But
before she had gone too far she was happily saved.
One morning her maid caught her, and the whole
household was agog. The miseries endured in the
few following weeks completely cured her. She
is now in private, as well as in public, as sound a
snob as ever reveled in &#8220;exclusiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is no isolated case. For bread and molasses
substitute any plain, natural human habit not tolerated
in England, and you have a story in outline
that would apply to hundreds. How contemptuously
our fashionables would deny if accused!
How indignantly the younger generations who
have never known what it was to be free from the
English strait-jacket would protest against such
coarse insinuations about our aristocracy. But the
laughable truth remains unshaken&mdash;and also the
truth that our aristocracy is wofully servant-pecked.</p>

<p>Fully to realize what a tremendous pressure this
servile aristocracy entrenched in the privacy of the
home can exert, let us glance at the composition of
a fashionable household in America to-day. Take
a family of some aspiring money-lender or stock
swindler or franchise grabber who has got together
in one way and another&mdash;principally another&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
fortune of a dozen millions or so. There are himself,
his wife with the longing to be &#8220;in it&#8221; or to
keep &#8220;in it&#8221; gnawing at her, the grown son and the
grown daughter. Papa is willing to have the family
show off, but he is not quite ready to go the
limit. So the establishment is what other fashionable
people call modest, and what his wife and two
children tell him is &#8220;mean.&#8221; Here is the schedule:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>General Staff</i>&mdash;Housekeeper, a broken-down
&#8220;gentlewoman&#8221;; butler, formerly with the Earl of
Tyne and still with him in spirit; chef, a Frenchman,
but thoroughly Anglicized in soul, though
not in accent or cooking; coachman, an Englishman,

<p>Quite a staff&mdash;and it does not include Madame&#8217;s
private secretary, an American, a &#8220;gentlewoman,&#8221;
thoroughly converted to the English system, or
Mademoiselle&#8217;s visiting governess, a product of ten
years&#8217; training in a New York private school for
the &#8220;young ladies of the upper class,&#8221; or extra servants
of all kinds that are constantly coming and
going. The total monthly pay-roll is never below
one thousand seven hundred dollars; often, in the
height of the winter season in New York or of the
summer season at Newport, it climbs up to two
thousand dollars. And, putting the feeding of all
these people at twenty dollars apiece a month,
which is exceedingly, ridiculously low, the board-bill
would be more than eight hundred dollars a
month. Then, naturally, all of them are as careless
and as wasteful as they dare to be, and, wherever
possible, corrupt in the taking of commissions from
the &#8220;tradespeople.&#8221; This means a squandering of
more than their wages and board together. But it
is indeed a most &#8220;modest&#8221; establishment&mdash;there
are at least a thousand in this country far more imposing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
Why, our hero has not even provided servants
for the servants of his servants! And, as
everybody knows, that is always done in a really
bang-up, swell, first-class establishment. Also, his
liveries, although what the &#8220;tradespeople&#8221; would
call elegant, are not nearly so sumptuous as those of
the neighboring establishments.</p>

<p>But, dissatisfied though the servants are, they
do their best to keep up appearances and they fight
strenuously for the caste system. They are, roughly
speaking, divided into five ranks. At the top stand
the private secretary, the visiting governess, and
the housekeeper. They are almost &#8220;gentlefolk&#8221;;
in fact, they are gentlefolk in abeyance, as it were,
like cadets of a royal house which has been kicked
out by its unfeeling subjects. Next come butler
and coachman and chef. Each admits the right of
the other two to high rank, but each feels toward
the others as they fancy a marquis must feel toward
an earl. Below these high haughtinesses is the
main body of servants, with the lowest rank made
up of stablemen, scullions, servants&#8217; servants. Each
servant fiercely insists upon his own station, and
still more fiercely insists upon the lower station of
those whom the code of caste has assigned there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
And all the servants insist upon the aristocratic
principle being enforced from top to bottom of the
household. The &#8220;master&#8221; and his wife, the boy
and the girl, know that if they for an instant drop
the pose they will be the butt of ridicule and contempt
in the servants&#8217; hall.</p>

<p>The effect of this incessant, subtle pressure upon
the grown people is strong enough. But they retain
some glimmerings of a sane point of view; at times
they realize that there is not a little rotten nonsense
in their mode of life. But think of the children!
They were born into this noisome atmosphere; they
are never allowed to breathe any other&mdash;for, even
when they go away to school, it is to some &#8220;select,&#8221;
&#8220;exclusive&#8221; institution, or to associate only with the
&#8220;select&#8221; and &#8220;exclusive&#8221; in the big college. They
know no more of the free and national and growing
American life than a Mammoth Cave fish knows
of the light and the radiant waters of the upper
world. They regard Americanism as synonymous
with demagoguery and anarchy. And they become
sincere and, because of their wealth and display,
successful missionaries of the gospel of snobbishness
to all the children of the rich and the well-to-do
brought into contact with them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>Truly, the service is not the most important item
that comes up the back stairs of the fine houses of
our plutocracy. The ideas&mdash;they are the real item.</p>

<p>English servants do not, as a rule, like to come
to this country. Few of the best class, as yet, will
consent to give up the splendor and assured aristocracy
of England and go to live among a lot of
vulgarians, hard though those vulgarians are striving
to be worthy of the support of an aristocratic
menialdom. Those few of the best who do condescend
to exile themselves wear sad faces and show
that they keenly feel the humiliation. For they
cannot blind themselves to the truth that their masters
and mistresses, striving hard to please and to
delude, are still not really &#8220;ladies&#8221; and &#8220;gentlemen,&#8221;
but just Americans. Have they titles? No.
Do the common people doff the hat to them? No.
Have they &#8220;ancestry&#8221;? They pretend to have, but
the genealogical trees look about as much like real
trees as the papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; palm looks like the
genuine thing; and Burke&#8217;s peerage and the Almanach
de Gotha know them not. No, they are
not aristocrats, and it pains the aristocratic servants
to serve them much as it would pain a first gentleman
of the bedchamber to King Edward to get on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
his knees to some &#8220;big nigger&#8221; who called himself
Emperor of Ashanteeland. The commiseration of
all sympathizers with sensitive souls belongs of
right to these aristocrats of menialdom in exile.</p>

<p>The great mass of these imported servants, excepting
those who come here for the chance to
become men and women and to shake off servitude,
are a worthless lot, weedings from those perfect
English gardens of menialdom. And a hard time
their American masters have with them. Insolence,
shiftlessness, drunkenness, petty thieving are tolerated
to and beyond the most asinine patience;
then, one furious day, the housekeeper, under
orders from an outraged master or mistress, ejects
the whole crew and gets in an entirely new lot.
But this revolt of the downtrodden &#8220;upper classes&#8221;
is rare and dangerous and often disastrous. For
this servile aristocracy is a close corporation, very
limited in numbers and fully awake to its own
power over the plutocrats who must at any cost in
money, manhood and discomfort have servility
and an imitation of the English way of living.
Woe, woe, woe unto the plutocrat who gets himself
on the imported servants&#8217; black-list! He may have
actually to close in whole or in part his vast houses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
and to cease from inviting in his hordes of rich
friends to see how much more gaudily he is showing
off than they are. He may have to call in colored
or plain Irish or Swedish servants, mostly women,
to save him and his family from the horrors of
waiting on themselves. But one shrinks from pushing
inquiry in so harrowing a direction.</p>

<p>How long will it be before we have a home-grown
menial aristocracy to bolster up and make
strong our fashionable aristocracy? It may be
longer than one might imagine. The educated
people, the lawyers, superintendents, merchants,
social, political and financial hangers-on, who serve
the plutocracy, fall easily into servile habits. The
big corporation lawyer and his family, the fifty
thousand dollars a year dummy railway president
and his family, eagerly pay court to the great plutocrat,
bow and scrape and mould themselves to his
and his family&#8217;s humors. But the &#8220;lower classes&#8221;
here remain obstinately insolent. They go into
plutocratic domestic service only under stress; they
act in a manner that exasperates their servility-seeking
employers; they leave as soon as they can
get any sort of job anywhere. Also, they rouse the
soundly sleeping or stunned manhood and womanhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
of the imported aristocracy-adoring servants,
and so compel the constant recruiting of the ranks
of the menial aristocracy by fresh importations.</p>

<p>True, among the mass of our immigrants, almost
all from countries where a real caste system
has prevailed always, there is a tendency toward a
searching after an aristocracy in this country. They
miss it; they cannot believe that a land in all its
physical aspects like unto the lands from which they
have fled should be without what has always
seemed to them a natural and necessary part of the
order of the universe. But they hunt for this aristocracy
not with the idea of worshipping it, but
with the idea of destroying it. And hence we find
that the loudest angry assertion of the existence of
a true aristocracy here comes from those of our
democracy-loving citizens who are foreign-born.
They see this monstrous pretense rearing itself as
imposingly as the true aristocracies of Europe; and
they do not pause to distinguish between marble
and plaster painted to look like marble. They
raise a wild shriek and demand that snickersnees
be drawn and that heads begin to fall. A natural
mistake, and highly gratifying to our would-be
aristocrats. They are not terrified by the uncouth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
and futile clamors; though to make the thing more
realistic to themselves, they sometimes pretend to
be. But they are through and through pleased at
hearing themselves in seriousness called what they
would fain believe themselves to be; and they say
delightedly: &#8220;At last, the lower classes begin to
recognize themselves, and us!&#8221;</p>

<p>But this rejoicing is premature. They are right
in seeing that it takes a body of self-confessed peasantry
to make a prince&mdash;that the prince proclaiming
himself and proclaimed by hirelings and dependents
only is no prince at all, but a laughing-stock.
But they are wrong in seeing signs of a
forming peasantry; what they see is an un-forming
peasantry&mdash;a vastly different matter.</p>

<p>The obstinacy of the American and thoroughly
Americanized &#8220;lower classes&#8221; seems incurable.
And until it is cured, until a body of citizens is
created that will accept the aristocratic idea not as
applying to themselves and making them superior,
but as applying to a fixed class of superiors to whom
they themselves must be and must remain inferiors&mdash;until
then, the plutocracy will sigh in vain for
transformation into an aristocracy. Imported servants
and our own snob graduates of snob colleges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
with yearnings after the &#8220;cultured and refining influences
of caste&#8221; will in vain crook the pregnant
hinges of the knee. The plutocracy will be
haunted and humiliated by the undignifying grin
of the &#8220;proletariat,&#8221; incurably and militantly democratic.</p>

<p>And the more excited about itself and eager to
show off the plutocracy becomes, the more insistent
and imperious will become the inquiry into the
origin and the rightfulness of these vast fortunes
that are being reaped where their owners have not
sown and squandered after the proverbial manner
of ill-gotten gains.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>PAUPER-MAKING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a story of a rich woman&mdash;an Austrian,
perhaps&mdash;who was chilled through by a long drive
on a bitter winter day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a huge fire in my sitting-room,&#8221; she said
to a servant as she entered her country house, &#8220;and
order wood distributed to the poor of the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat by the huge fire for ten minutes and then
rang the bell. &#8220;Never mind about distributing that
wood,&#8221; she said to the answering servant. &#8220;The
weather seems to have moderated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The theory back of this story is the popular one:
that the great comfort of great wealth hardens the
rich, makes them insensible to privation. The fact
is the reverse&mdash;at least so far as America is concerned.
Nowhere in the world is the value of
wealth so grossly, so ludicrously over-estimated as
among our plutocrats&mdash;not unnaturally, since their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
only title to distinction is their wealth, and a man
cannot but reverence that which makes him distinguished.
Nowhere, therefore, are the discomforts
of poverty so exaggerated as in the palaces of our
very rich. And so eager are the men as well as
the women for opportunities to exercise their emotions
over poverty and destitution that they are
rapidly creating a huge pauper class. Demand is
creating supply.</p>

<p>The poor give to the poor through sympathy.
The rich give to the poor through pity. The sympathetic
poor are many, and so their pennies and
food-donations, small in the single, pile up mountainously
in the total. But they are sparsely and
more or less judiciously, because intelligently, distributed.
The very rich are, comparatively,
though not absolutely, many; and they almost all
give what seems to the ordinary run of well-to-do
people very large sums. They give carelessly,
freely. Though warned by often-exposed abuses,
they never take warning. Each new fraud finds
them credulous and eager. They want to give;
they want to show that they are generous and helpful;
to caution them is to irritate them.</p>

<p>Thus pauperization is a vast and thriving industry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
It is said, and there is no reason to doubt
it, that there are several hundred families on Manhattan
Island&mdash;enough to populate a small city&mdash;that
have lived well for years wholly upon charity,
no member of them ever doing any work beyond
writing begging letters or patrolling begging
routes. In addition there are thousands of families
supported in large part by relief got from rich men
and rich women. And the same state of affairs is
found wherever the very rich, living exclusive and
aloof lives, have built their palaces.</p>

<p>To play Lord or Lady Bountiful is such a self-gratifying
part. It is the traditional, the conventional
part of the very rich toward the very poor.
Beggars are so voluble in thanks. It sounds so
well to talk of &#8220;my worthy poor,&#8221; of what &#8220;I am
doing for charity.&#8221; So many hours that would
otherwise be boresome can be filled with receiving
and patronizing cringing, slathering paupers or
with nosing about tenements, receiving on every
floor noisy showers of blessings in exchange for less
than the price of a supper after the theatre.</p>

<p>The whole business lessens the vanity-disturbing
doubts that sometimes will arise even among the
very rich as to the validity of the distinctions in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
Democracy between &#8220;upper class&#8221; and &#8220;lower
classes.&#8221; In some cases the motive is higher. In
many cases there is an admixture of the higher
motive. But the persistence of the very rich in
face of the plain showings of the harm they do
makes it impossible entirely to acquit large numbers
of them.</p>

<p>The pauperization plants of plutocracy fall into
three classes&mdash;the public, the semi-public and the
private.</p>

<p>The politicians have expanded, where they have
not out and out established, the public plants. Instead
of making the people realize the truth&mdash;that
these plants are their property, paid for out of
their wages and giving service to them not as
charity, but as their hard-earned, paid-for right,
the politicians turn them into favor-distributing
centres, centres for the distribution of alms in exchange
for political power. The semi-public plants
for the manufacture of paupers are the gifts of very
rich men, usually men who made their own money;
after the first generation the very rich do not as a
rule go in for large public gifts. It is never profitable
or just to examine deep into motives; sufficient
to say that, with a few exceptions, these semi-public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
philanthropic institutions for giving something
in exchange for nothing are avoided by all
but such of the poor as don&#8217;t mind thinking themselves
paupers or being looked on and treated as
paupers.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the private pauperization
plants. From them might be excepted those of the
rich men and the rich women who have gone into
the relief business in a systematic way and operate
through thoroughly organized, carefully and competently
conducted bureaus. Their theory of helping
is not exactly consistent with the old American
idea of &#8220;root hog or die,&#8221; but neither is it wholly
exploitation of their own personal vanity without
any regard to the merits of applicants. They give
relief, but they try to make sure that relief is, according
to their very liberal notion of necessity,
needed.</p>

<p>Probably all but a very few of the families that
are famous throughout the country for wealth have
organizations of this kind. But there are upward
of ten thousand millionaires concentrated in a few
cities, several hundred of them multi-millionaires.
The overwhelming majority of these go in for
philanthropy, not on the carefully organized system,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
but more or less haphazard giving, with never
thorough investigation, often with no investigation
whatever.</p>

<p>It seems impossible to make people in the habit
of keeping themselves clean believe that dirt is not
necessarily or even frequently a proof positive of
poverty overwhelmed by adversity against which
it has made an honest struggle. And the rich
people who like the &#8220;Bountiful&#8221; pose refuse to believe
that almost all honest destitution is relieved
by its neighbors and relatives, that nine out of ten
cases of destitution are fraudulent, that all the
street beggars are liars, that no one need go hungry
or shelterless or cold if he will apply to the public
or semi-public institutions ready to relieve. So,
we have Lord and Lady Bountiful relieving grown
people of the necessity of &#8220;hustling,&#8221; and, worst of
all, encouraging them to bring up their children as
paupers and beggars.</p>

<p>So scandalous has this industry of pauper-making
become that in every city&#8217;s highways there
are now children openly begging, telling their whining
lies of various more or less ingenious kinds, pretending
to sell newspapers or pencils or shoe-strings
to give a color of respectability to their shamelessness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
or, rather, to the shamelessness of their
parents.</p>

<p>The passing generation&mdash;the rustling, hustling,
money-grabbing generation&mdash;is usually rather
shrewd in its philanthropies, as well as generous.
The &#8220;old man&#8221; was a car-driver, or a brakeman,
or a plow-boy, or a peasant&#8217;s son. He has poverty&#8217;s
sympathy with poverty, but also poverty&#8217;s
suspicion of the cause of poverty. Thus, our cities
have got and are getting libraries, hospitals, free
dispensaries, free technical schools of various kinds,
model tenements, and the like. Millions on millions
are given annually by &#8220;self-made&#8221; men, most
of it as wisely as giving can be.</p>

<p>But shrewd as these men are, they often fail to
see the difference between the sympathetic, unselfish,
man-to-man individual help they as poor
boys got from people of their own kind in better
circumstances, and this general, unequal, pitying,
condescending charity which gives indiscriminatingly
something that is of value only to the self-respecting,
and too often takes away in exchange
all, or nearly all, self-respect.</p>

<p>Still, though these &#8220;self-made&#8221; men give and
give largely and with many mistakes, they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
the fear of pauper-making ever in mind. And
when they give to individuals they try to be doubly
careful.</p>

<p>In the second generation&mdash;what used to be but
is no longer the spendthrift generation&mdash;the very
rich retrench in the matter of large benefactions.
The family position is established. None of the
members of it has ever known what it is to be
hungry or cold without knowing just where to turn
for food and warmth. Sympathy, which was the
sentiment in the first generation, now becomes pity.
Man-to-man is changed into &#8220;Bountiful&#8221; and his
or her &#8220;worthy poor.&#8221; And we have the pauper-plant
in full blast.</p>

<p>Each day every rich man or woman who is at all
well known receives large numbers of begging letters&mdash;from
beggars in Maine and in Texas, in
Florida and in Washington, in all parts of the
Union. They want loans. They want notes or
mortgages paid. They want pianos and trousseaus.
They want pensions for crippled sons or
daughters. Or they want anything from old
clothes to several thousand dollars to buy a farm
or a store. The apparent effrontery of these requests
disappears as the letters are read and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
amazing, even pathetic, simplicity of the writers
stands out.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, some of these requests, preposterous
though they are, are granted. A skilfully
written letter sent to a certain kind of rich
person at just the right moment has been known
to produce amazing results. No reader of this
book, however, need advise a beggar of his acquaintance
to try it. The two cents postage would
be far more likely to bring a return if invested in
stocks of the mines of the mountains in the moon.
There are many of the rich who have every begging
letter that is at all reasonable or plausible
thoroughly investigated by a secretary&mdash;or by some
local agent of a corporation in which the recipient
happens to be interested. Pity for the &#8220;worthy
poor&#8221; is an extremely potent force in the plutocracy.</p>

<p>But it is local pauper-making that has the greatest
fascination for the rich man or woman who does
not care to go into charity on the Carnegie or Rockefeller
or Armour scale, or to take the trouble to
organize a bureau that works with precision and
without any advertisement of its owner. The
&#8220;agony stories&#8221; cooked up by the newspapers are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
noted, the slums are ransacked, the parasites on
&#8220;charity,&#8221; both those who honestly deceive themselves
and those who deliberately &#8220;graft,&#8221; are
eagerly welcomed and listened to. Thus there are
a good many thousands of rich city dwellers with
incomes ranging from twenty thousand to several
hundred thousands a year, each of whom has his or
her circle of &#8220;worthy poor,&#8221; or gives regularly to
those myriad petty enterprises of misdirected or
barefacedly fraudulent charity which enlist the
activities of so many &#8220;workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The women are the most persistent and unreasonable
offenders in this respect. Partly through
idleness, partly through a craving to have occupation
and a sense of usefulness, partly through a
profound pity for their apparently unfortunate sisters,
they pour out capital for pauper-plants and
search diligently for &#8220;worthy poor&#8221; to pauperize.</p>

<p>Among the long-very-rich there is notable shyness
of the larger kinds of giving. No doubt at bottom
this is due to increasing selfishness, increasing
absorption in amusements of the wholly selfish
kinds. It costs more and more every year to play
the rich man&#8217;s part; more and more imagination is
brought to bear in developing it, both by rich men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
eager to find new ways of showing off and by ingenious
poor men inventing new ways of making
a living out of the rich upon whose extravagance
they thrive. The rich man, even where his income
is huge, is often pinched. He hates to give&mdash;he
may find that his giving has compelled him to
forego a most attractive investment or has compelled
him to abstain from some new expensive
luxury or pleasure. He hoards, to be ready for
such emergencies. Then if he has several children,
he wants to leave each of them as rich as possible
so that they can all live in the style to which they
have been accustomed, the style in which their
friends and associates live. For worship of wealth
you must look among the long-very-rich. Those
who pass Mammon&#8217;s statue with a nod or a half-ashamed
crook of a reluctant knee will have the
pleasure of seeing very, very many of the rich &#8220;old
families&#8221; flat in the dust, noses plowing it, and not
a bit ashamed.</p>

<p>Is this drying up of the charity of &#8220;philanthropy&#8221;
wholly a matter for regret?</p>

<p>Several years ago a few young Americans from
various parts of the country began to spend their
summer vacations at Woods Hole, Massachusetts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
They were young; they were poor; they were obscure;
they were hard-worked and hard-working
as well; they were profoundly indifferent to money
or money gain; they were not even bothering especially
about fame. They had as their common
bond a passion for science. They had as their
common aim the satisfying of that divine curiosity
which makes the man who has it toil incessantly
and unweariedly over ways more arduous and
through wildernesses more dangerous than those
that baffled the seekers after the Holy Grail. They
longed&mdash;these earnest, poor, obscure young Americans&mdash;to
penetrate to Nature&#8217;s innermost laboratory,
her workshop of workshops, her temple of
temples, there to surprise her supreme secret&mdash;the
mystery of the origin of life.</p>

<p>Fifteen summers of this pursuit, free from self-seeking
or sordidness or jealousy, free from fame&#8217;s
flatteries, and the Marine Biological Laboratory
of Woods Hole became famous wherever the
human intellect is respected. Its Knights of
Science have not reached their goal&mdash;their Holy
Grail. But under the inspiration of the triple vow
of Science for her Knights&mdash;poverty, self-immolation
and obedience to truth&mdash;they have had adventures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
and have made discoveries so strange, so
passing strange, so wonderful, that all Americans
are intensely proud of this American institution, at
once so small and so majestically great.</p>

<p>Then came the proposal to endow this little
laboratory with part of the Carnegie millions and
to erect it into a rich and aristocratic palace of
science. At first glance the proposal seemed as
admirable as the purpose that prompted it. And
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This is a day when the numerous newcomers
among our multi-millionaires are so pouring out the
millions that it looks as if presently the necessity for
struggle, the incentive to struggle, in the development
of brain power, would be almost wholly removed.
In the progress of the race, wealth in possession
has played a very small part&mdash;has more
often interfered to blight than to bless. Wealth
possessed means ease and power without effort, and
a sense that the goal has been reached. It means
the mind at rest, tending to sloth and slumber, with
life&#8217;s greatest fears and greatest incentives removed.
Above all, it means an atmosphere of self-complacency
and satiety and languor that insensibly
relaxes the strongest fibre.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>Carnegie millions may help to keep a-burning
the light in that plain little temple of science at
Woods Hole&mdash;<i>may</i>, if judiciously used. But not
if they stifle the splendid, self-sacrificing, self-unconscious
enthusiasm which set that light a-blazing.
The lesson is wider than the instance&mdash;far wider.
It was wealth and patronage that rotted the splendid
intellect of Greece; wealth again, and patronage,
that brought the Renaissance to an abrupt, inglorious
end. And how much the English intellect
in its long period of most brilliant achievement
owed to the contempt of the English dominant
classes&mdash;that of birth and that of commerce&mdash;for
scientists, writers and &#8220;those kinds of cattle!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE MADE-OVER WHITE HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> find plutocracy&#8217;s follies in full swing not
alone in the great cities, East and West, where the
money-caste must have outward signs of superiority
to bolster up its pretensions, but in our national
capital as well&mdash;in what ought to be the high-set
citadel of democratic dignity.</p>

<p>Few Americans have any adequate idea of the
system of etiquette which has grown up there. The
other day a newly appointed high officer of the
Government said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter went to lunch with the daughter
of Secretary &mdash;&mdash; yesterday. She did not come
home until long after she was expected, and her
mother asked her what was the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; she explained, &#8216;Secretary &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s
daughter was there, and none of us could go until
she left, and we thought she never would go.&#8217; And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
I find that precedent is carried out in the strictest
possible way all through Washington society in all
its sets, down to the very children.&#8221;</p>

<p>If there are any persons in official life in Washington
who do not attach importance to precedence,
do not resent being seated out of rank at table, or
being in all other ways given their exact official
amount of deference, those persons keep extremely
quiet. In Washington one ceases to be surprised
at hearing men of national reputation complaining
fiercely because they have been subjected to some
trivial slight in this matter of precedence. It irritates
a Cabinet officer to be put a shade out of his
rank just as much as it irritates a Congressman
from nowhere or a Government clerk.</p>

<p>Precedence is killing Washington as a place of
residence for sensible people. It is destroying its
chief charm. If one thinks of going there to live
it is because he expects to meet in the easy circumstance
of social intercourse those who are interesting
or amusing or curious. That sort of social
intercourse is becoming practically impossible. No
one giving any sort of entertainment, however informal,
dares to arrange his or her guests according
to congeniality. The same people must always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
be put next each other. The same man must take
the same woman in to dinner. The same youth
must dance with the same girl. And as official life
expands the blight of precedence spreads.</p>

<p>It is difficult for an outsider to listen without
laughing or showing irritation as the Washingtonians
discuss precedence and relate incidents of
national and international catastrophes almost
brought about by violation of it. But as some of
the persons who most strenuously insist upon it are
otherwise high above the human average, it would
be well, before utterly condemning the Washingtonians,
to reflect whether the craze for precedence
is not a universal human weakness, latent&mdash;happily
latent&mdash;in most of us because it has no chance to
show itself.</p>

<p>There is a certain officer who, in the official lists,
is called Superintendent of Public Buildings and
Grounds. In fact he is &#8220;Lord Great Chamberlain&#8221;
to the President. Perhaps there was once a
Lord Great Chamberlain who was merely Superintendent
of Public Buildings and Grounds at the
lower end of Pennsylvania avenue. But that was
a long time ago.</p>

<p>For many years the Major of Engineers assigned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
to that title with the rank and pay of Colonel
has been actually the chief officer of the President&#8217;s
court, the manager of what might be called
his public household. Whenever the President entertains
on a grand scale he is obviously in command,
directing the ceremonials, superintending
the evolutions of his staff of dancing and small-talk
army men, overseeing the assiduities of the court
retinue of servants. When a new ambassador or
other eminent personage, domestic or foreign, arrives,
he is the functionary who puts on a gorgeous
uniform, drives in state in the President&#8217;s carriage
to the visitor&#8217;s lodgings, escorts him to the President,
introduces him, takes him away and escorts
him back to his lodgings. Also, he in large measure
directs the expenditures from the White House
privy purse.</p>

<p>The Constitution and the Statute Book make no
provision for a Lord Great Chamberlain. But
constitutions and institutions are vastly different.
Part of the President&#8217;s time is given to matters contained
or supposed to be contained in the written
laws, the larger part to matters set down in the unwritten
laws and nowhere else. When we broke
away from Europe and European political and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
social ideas, we did not get rid of those customs for
high executive officers which had been established
among us by royal colonial governors, although
they were simple compared with the growing dimensions
of our present-day ceremonial.</p>

<p>Thus the unwritten laws say that the President
must have a court like a king or other royal reigning
person. It must be disguised and modified,
but it must be &#8220;the real thing&#8221; in its essence. A
court involves a place to hold it, officers to conduct
it, an etiquette to guide it, and money to keep it
going. The written laws provide for a Presidential
residence&mdash;they permit the President to sit rent-free.
That provision readily stretches to cover a
place to hold the court.</p>

<p>Again, the written laws permit the President to
detach certain public officers for rather indefinite
purposes. There you have a Lord Great Chamberlain
and a Lord High Steward, and so forth,
provided with comparative ease.</p>

<p>As for etiquette, that part of the unwritten law
need not be reconciled to written law, because etiquette
costs nothing but headaches and heart-burnings&mdash;and
the only reason for attempting to reconcile
written law and unwritten is, of course, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
matter of money expense. Finally, the written laws
provide, or can be stretched to provide, the money
for all the bigger items of court expenses&mdash;furnishings
and repairs and alterations, linen, china,
flowers, cooks, scullions, butlers, coachmen, footmen,
door-openers and door-closers, card-carriers,
light, heat, everything except what is eaten and
drunk. As yet no way has been found to stretch
the written law or the good nature of Congress to
cover the court appetite. It must be appeased out
of the President&#8217;s salary.</p>

<p>The most important, though by no means the
most expensive, item in the court budget charged
against the public, is the Lord Great Chamberlain
who conducts the court and executes, either directly
or indirectly, all that pertains to the social side of
life at the White House. He is always an officer
of engineers. He must be a person of knowledge,
of tact, of good appearance.</p>

<p>Lord Great Chamberlain has ever been a distinguished
office. It was never so distinguished as
now. And, unless there is some sort of extraordinary
convulsion and revulsion, it is destined to
become almost eminent. For the White House has
entered a new and dazzling period of social splendor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
which may presently make it as little different
from the residence of a monarch as is the Elys&eacute;e
Palace, where lives the President of France&#8217;s imperial
Democracy.</p>

<p>The newly evolved notion of the Presidential
office is that it is the centre of political, intellectual
and sociological authority and also of social honor.
Not only must the democratic&mdash;or plutocratic&mdash;overlord,
anointed with the new kind of divine oil,
be the embodiment and exponent of the popular
will; he must also be the source of honor, the recognizer
of merit.</p>

<p>Does one sing well? Does one paint well? Does
one write well? Does one lead in education or
literature or law or sociology or finance or commerce
or trade&mdash;or fashion? Is one in the forefront
in any line of activity not definitely declared
criminal? Then the President of the American
people must entertain him, must take his hand in
that hand which is a sort of composite of eighty
million right hands of fellowship. The approving
accents of that voice which is now conceived to be
the composite of eighty million approving voices
must tickle his ravished ears; he must, at the Presidential
board, eat and drink the composite hospitalities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
of the eighty millions&#8217; dinner or luncheon
tables.</p>

<p>In a real plain-as-an-old-coat Democracy the
President would be a business person only, keeping
his official life and his social life separate and distinct.
The one would be public, the other private.
He would have no more to do privately with
those with whom he is officially brought into contact
than would the head of a big business with his
assistants, employ&eacute;s and customers. Social life is
in a democratic society altogether of and by the
family; and theoretically the President&#8217;s wife and
children, the wives and children of the other public
officials, are left in private life when the man of the
family takes office. Practically, however, they are
all elected, and if the written law provides no
honors for wife and children and other relatives of
the successful candidate, unwritten law must be
created to repair the grave, the intolerable
omission.</p>

<p>Hence the elaborate, the complex, the awe-inspiring
system of precedence. Every one from
the President and his family and their remotest
connection visiting Washington, down through all
the branches of official life to grand-niece of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
scrubwoman who sees to the basement steps of the
smallest public building, has his or her exactly defined
and jealously guarded station in the social
hierarchy.</p>

<p>Naturally, the most interesting part of the imposing
structure that descends tier on tier from the
august and exalted Chief Magistrate, is the court&mdash;the
President, his Cabinet (Cabinet &#8220;ministers,&#8221; to
give them the fanciful title they love best), the
ambassadors and ministers and staffs of the various
embassies and legations, the families of all
these, and this means the White House and the
Lord Great Chamberlain&mdash;the White House, the
stage; the Lord Great Chamberlain, the stage
manager.</p>

<p>The White House was always inadequate&mdash;it
would have been inadequate only for carrying out
the purely democratic idea of the Presidential office,
the idea set forth in the written laws. For
the splendid, imperial, democratic concept of the
plutocracy, the White House was ridiculous. Many
a previous President and his wife, conscious of the
social possibilities of the Presidential office, and
yearning to develop them, have sighed over and
moaned over and hinted about the petty proportions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
of the &#8220;Executive Mansion.&#8221; But political
timidity restrained them from insisting upon expansion
and elaboration. Mr. Roosevelt, confident
that the people understood and approved him, and
full of enthusiasm for his exalted concept of a new
Presidency to suit a new era of the republic, boldly
ventured where other Presidents had shrunk back.
He demanded adequate quarters for the imperial-democratic
court. The result is a new White
House, a fit theatre for plutocratic social activities,
a fit field for the operations of an energetic and
sympathetic Lord Great Chamberlain.</p>

<p>The present President entertains, not occasionally
but constantly, not exclusively but as democratically
as an emperor, not meagrely but lavishly, not
a score of guests, but hundreds and thousands. He
has a multitude of guests to lunch, a multitude to
dine, a multitude to hear music or to take part in
various kinds of &#8220;drawing-rooms&#8221; and levees, a
multitude to stay the night under his roof&mdash;not a
multitude all at one time, but a multitude in the
aggregate. Rich and poor, snob and democrat, plutocrat
and proletarian, black and white, American
and foreigner, Maine woods guide, Western scout,
fashionable and frowzy&mdash;all equally welcome, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
equal at his court. Morgan and Jacob Riis, Countess
de Castellane and Booker Washington, Wild
Bill and Bishop Potter, Duse and Rough Rider
Rob, Alfred Henry Lewis and a New York cotillon
leader.</p>

<p>Not long ago when some one said in his hearing,
&#8220;There&#8217;s no first-class hotel in Washington,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;You forget the White House.&#8221; He has
made it indeed a national hotel, or rather a great
national assembling place. And he is ever unsatisfied,
ever reaching out for more &#8220;doers,&#8221; for more
and more people of interest or importance. He
wishes all people of mark to bask in the Presidential
sunshine, to give him the benefit of their intellect
or character, or whatever they may have that
is worth seeing or hearing. For he wishes to receive
as well as to give. And he is determined that
his court shall be entirely and completely representative.
The world has seen nothing like it in
recent centuries; the Emperor of Germany, broad
though his sympathies are, is a snob in comparison.
For a parallel we must go back to the courts of the
emperor-presidents of Rome, in the days when
Rome thought itself a republic. And the exigencies
of plutocratic politics and the new social conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
have combined to attract the leaders of plutocracy&#8217;s
fashion in plutocracy&#8217;s capitals, New York and Chicago,
to favor Washington more and more each
winter with their presence and their patronage.</p>

<p>The new White House, which is thus in a fair
way to become the social centre of the republic,
is in one sense the first step toward an entirely new
Washington. In every street at all fit for Presidential
purposes great houses are going up for the
leisurely rich, and smaller but attractive houses for
the leisurely well-to-do. It is obvious to the most
casual observer that to-morrow will see a brilliant
and numerous society seated at Washington, a society
devoted to luxury and entertaining and revolving
round the President, and dazzling and
dominating the servants of the people. Of all the
bribes, which is so seductive, so insidiously corrupting
as the social bribe?</p>

<p>At the Congressional Library are exhibited models
of the Washington the public administration
purposes to build, has already begun to build. It
will be a city of magnificent boulevards and parks
and drives, and public buildings and national monuments.
It will be probably the most splendid and
most beautiful city in the world. It will probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
be the one great city on earth where all who are
not servants and tradespeople think and talk chiefly
politics, literature, art, science&mdash;when they are not
talking gossip and envying each other&#8217;s rank or
looks or clothes or establishments.</p>

<p>The made-over White House, astounding
though it is as a sudden development, is but the
crude inaugural of this Washington of to-morrow.
But it is a beginning&mdash;a most audacious move on
the part of one of the most audacious men who
ever rose to first place in the republic. It is indeed
audacious to be a democratic President with the
ceremonial of a king&mdash;&#8220;a ceremonial more rigid
than that of the court of the Czar,&#8221; according to
the wife of one of the ambassadors.</p>

<p>The White House demand upon Congress for
running expenses has leaped from the former twenty-five
thousand dollars to sixty thousand dollars.
As the President&#8217;s salary is just under a thousand
dollars a week, and as he evidently believes the
people expect the President to spend his salary upon
the embellishment of the position, it appears that
the new White House, the new court, is now on
the average costing in the neighborhood of two
thousand dollars a week, half from the pocket of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
the people, the other half from the President&#8217;s private
pocket.</p>

<p>As the heavy expense is crowded into five months
of the year&mdash;December to April, inclusive&mdash;the
probabilities are that the new White House is costing
during the season not far from three thousand
dollars a week. This means that the new departure
has certainly doubled, and perhaps trebled,
the cost of the White House court, for most Presidents
have contributed about half their salary toward
holding court and have called on Congress
for a supplementary appropriation of twenty-five
thousand dollars a year.</p>

<p>A few years ago such imposing figures as these
would have caused a great outcry. In every part
of the land, in city as well as country, hands would
have been thrown up, and &#8220;we, the people,&#8221; would
have ejaculated: &#8220;Three thousand dollars a week!
Mercy on us! The fellow must be crazy. What
<i>are</i> we coming to?&#8221;</p>

<p>But we think in large sums these days, and the
establishments of our multi-millionaires have accustomed
us to big expenditures for what were less
than half a generation ago universally regarded as
prodigalities. Scores of millionaires spend several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
times two thousand dollars a week in &#8220;maintaining
their dignity.&#8221; There were some faint, shamefaced
mutterings in Congress against the alterations
in the White House and the lively leap of
the public share in the expenses. But these mutterings
died away instead of growing stronger, and
the project for raising the Presidential salary to
one hundred thousand dollars a year has all but
passed Congress.</p>

<p>In the competition of display, of &#8220;splurge,&#8221; shall
&#8220;we, the people&#8221; be distanced by private persons?
Is not &#8220;blowing it in&#8221; the great test of dignity
and worth, the test established by our most &#8220;successful&#8221;
citizens? Yet a few years and the President
will be getting one hundred thousand dollars
in salary and will think himself moderate in calling
upon the nation for twice sixty thousand a year to
be spent in maintaining the Presidential dignity.
Less than that will seem shabby in the new Washington
under the spell of the new concept of the
Presidency as a social font. Simplicity and quiet as
a measure of dignity will belong to the past. It
still remains true, as when Burke said it, that &#8220;the
public is poor.&#8221; True, the nation has riches, but
only a few have wealth. True, wages have not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
actually increased over what they were <i>thirty years
ago</i>. True, the incomes of the great mass of Americans
are just about where they used to be; true,
taxation is to them still a burden, and &#8220;making the
ends meet&#8221; is still an anxious problem. But our
plutocrats and the representatives of kings and
other tax-eaters and people-plunderers must feel at
home when they honor our White House with their
presence.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest surface indication that
the Lord Great Chamberlain will preside over a
diminished office. Public business in the narrow,
strictly legal, old-fashioned democratic sense has
now for the first time wholly withdrawn from the
White House and is seated in what is derisively
and not inaptly called the &#8220;Executive Hen-coop&#8221;&mdash;a
temporary office building near by. The White
House has been definitely and apparently permanently
transformed into a place devoted to that
part of the Presidential office which is not recognized
in written law and which has hitherto been
kept in the background.</p>

<p>And so rapidly is the White House developing
that no one need be astonished if it almost immediately
becomes the social Mecca of the whole
American people. Any one who has studied the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
effect of social life upon political life, of social customs
upon politics, will appreciate that that transformation
might be of profound and far-reaching
importance. It might be significant of a new kind
of republic, of a fallen Democracy on this American
continent. It might well mean that the dream
of all aggressive, self-aggrandizing office-holders
had at last been realized; that for the people-ruled
public administration contemplated by the fathers
and embodied in the Constitution had been substituted
a real, a people-ruling government.</p>

<p>For, more powerful than any written laws, are
the unwritten laws that bind men in the slowly,
noiselessly forged chains of Habit.</p>

<p>And what a busy, big man the Lord Great
Chamberlain would be then!</p>

<p>But he would still be called Superintendent of
Public Buildings and Grounds, and the Most Puissant
Over-lord of the Imperial Plutocracy would
still be called President of the United States. And
so nobody would in the least mind. If the waffle
is named &#8220;Hot Waffle,&#8221; only a carping, croaking
pessimist notes that it is stone cold.</p>

<p>Such are the <i>surface</i> indications. But surface
indications are not infallible; they have been known
to be unimportant and wholly misleading.</p>

<small>AND EUROPE LAUGHS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> attach&eacute; of one of the Continental Embassies
to the King of England was dining at the Carlton
with an American, an old friend of his. The room
was filled with English and Americans. Almost
all the English were men and women of title or
rank, or both. Almost all the Americans were
well known both at home and abroad because of
their wealth, their fondness for display, and their
intimacies and relationships by marriage with the
aristocratic caste of Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Americans are popular here,&#8221; said the
diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented the American.</p>

<p>&#8220;And on the Continent also,&#8221; said the diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the American. &#8220;How the German
Emperor does love us&mdash;he is almost as enthusiastic
about us as is King Edward.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>&#8220;You are popular,&#8221; went on the diplomat, &#8220;and
very unpopular. You were never so popular nor
so unpopular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean we are unpopular because of the
American trade invasion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. That is a trifling matter. It concerns
only the politicians and a few manufacturers
and the farmers, and does not concern them very
deeply. No&mdash;let me explain. Formerly we&mdash;and
when I say &#8216;we&#8217; I mean the upper classes of
Europe, those which still rule, despite all this talk
about the progress of Democracy&mdash;formerly we
feared you; we pretended to despise you, but in fact
we were afraid. You were the great experiment
in Democracy, that is, in anarchy&mdash;in the rule of
the masses, the mob. Your success meant serious
trouble for us, if not the handwriting on the
wall, because our masses were always thinking of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the diplomat smiled peculiarly and glanced
round the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now all that has been changed,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;Europe and America are better acquainted. We
no longer fear you. Why should we?&#8221;</p>

<p>And again he paused to let his glance travel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
round the room, finally to rest with good-humored
satire upon the American&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;we understand you better. Our fears
have been proved groundless, our suspicions have
been justified. Your new path, after making a
wide bend, has returned into the old historic highway
of caste. And so our upper class, which hated
you, now&mdash;well, it neither loves nor admires you,
but it honors and courts you. It laughs a little at
your pretensions to birth. But it respects the solid
foundation of your aristocracy&mdash;wealth. For, no
matter what we may pretend, not blood, but money,
wealth, is the essence of aristocracy. As for our
masses, that once looked up to you as their
ideal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;They no longer look up to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They look down upon you. They see that you,
too, have your dominating class just as they have.
And they prefer their own kind of upper class as
less sordid, less vulgar, the embodiment of a more
inspiring ideal. So long as they knew you only
by report they believed in you; and that belief
still makes them restless under us. But now that
they have seen you, now that you are constantly in
evidence, they see that their hopes&mdash;at least so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
far as they were based upon you&mdash;were a foolish
dream. They prefer their own princes to &#8216;bosses&#8217;
and upstart newly-rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose these Americans whom you see
over here and whom you read most about are not
representative?&#8221;</p>

<p>The diplomat smiled. &#8220;I have heard that before,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But, my dear friend, they are
representative. Your country has changed and you
do not realize it. You are deceived, not we. You
are like the Romans who thought they had a republic
when, in fact, the republic had been dead
five hundred years. Think a moment. What sort
of men did you formerly send to us as diplomats?
And what sort of men do you send now? What
has become of the old horror of court dress and
rank and precedence which they used to exhibit?
You cannot deny that your diplomats are representative.
And are they not of the same class as
these ladies and gentlemen about us here, so obviously
delighted with themselves and their aristocratic
company, with themselves because of their
company?&#8221;</p>

<p>There is much truth in the diplomat&#8217;s comments
on the state of European public sentiment toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
America. And the change is, as he said, due to
better acquaintance. Europe thinks it has discovered
that as soon as an American rises in prosperity
above the mass of his fellow-citizens, he enters an
actual ruling class that dictates and disdains the
laws, uses them for enriching himself and for exploiting
the mass of his fellow-countrymen. Europe
thinks that as soon as he reaches this stage
he turns his eyes longingly toward the Old World
monarchies and begins to plan to become as nearly
like the aristocrats as possible. He may not flaunt
his power&mdash;he must respect republican forms. But
he may, and does, flaunt his wealth. And in
Europe he can get open recognition of his superior
rank when such recognition as it gets at home is
indirect and more or less secret.</p>

<p>Thousands of Americans live in Europe. Every
considerable city on the Continent has its American
colony, and year by year these colonies grow apace.
Americans&mdash;chiefly the women&mdash;have intermarried
everywhere into the European nobility. Nearly
all these expatriated Americans are people of
means; many of them are rich. They lead lives
of industrious idleness. Many of them frankly
express their contempt for the country from which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
they draw their incomes, the country but for which
they would be miserable peasants, sweating for the
amusement of some European land-holder.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that their dislike of their native
land has been strong enough to take them away
and to keep them away; it is a pity that the migrating
impulse does not seize upon more of their kind.
The world has room for idlers&mdash;it has room for
all sorts of people. But America has no room for
them. That great workshop wants no idlers obstructing
the aisles and hindering the toilers at their
tasks. That would be a sorry day for us when our
rapidly growing leisure class should &#8220;civilize&#8221; and
&#8220;refine&#8221; America into an agreeable place of residence
for &#8220;ladies&#8221; and &#8220;gentlemen&#8221; of the European
pattern.</p>

<p>These Americans who have &#8220;outgrown&#8221; their
country serve to confirm Europe in the suspicions
raised by the news that has reached it of stupendous
aristocratic changes in the American people, of
rotten political machines ruled by the rich, of toll-gates
set up on every highway of American trade
and commerce for the tax-gatherers of plutocracy,
of a people fatuously imagining that it is free because
it can go to the polls and freely choose which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
of two sets of candidates shielded by the plutocracy
shall make and execute the laws. This brings up
the whole subject of our relations with &#8220;abroad&#8221;&mdash;and
the social and political meaning and tendency
of those relations.</p>

<p>A few years ago Paris was the paradise of Americans,
especially of the Americans of wealth. It is
so no longer. It is now for them a mere stopping-place
for buying clothes&mdash;a pause <i>en route</i> to the
true, fashionable, American Mecca, London. A
few years ago Americans, except those of the ordinary
sight-seeing, mind-improving kind, loathed
London. They knew few people there&mdash;and, like
Vienna, London is an impossible place for the
stranger in search of amusement; if he does not
know natives, is not invited to their houses, a soundless
desert is a cheerful, companionable place in
comparison. Further, such English as the rich,
fashionable, amusement-hunting American knew&mdash;that
is, such Englishmen &#8220;of the right sort&#8221;&mdash;were
about as friendly and sociable as they are to their
servants. But that was before the &#8220;Anglo-Saxon
Alliance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The change came with the British discovery that
the American multi-millionaire and the American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
heiress were not, as had been supposed, rarities
found only occasionally after long search through
trackless and vast wildernesses of &#8220;unspeakable
bounders,&#8221; but were deposited in &#8220;the States&#8221; in
quantities, were easily accessible, were yearning for
high society, for aristocracy, for titled friends, for
titled alliances. This was tidings of great joy to
the English aristocracy. For an aristocrat may
not work; and no matter how heavily &#8220;endowed&#8221;
a title may be, values will shrink as time passes&mdash;not
to speak of those savage &#8220;death duties&#8221; which
the rascally Liberals enacted to the infuriating of
the upper classes, who yet dare not repeal them.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Anglo-Saxon Alliance&#8221; began forthwith.
Scores of English upper-class families opened their
hearts and their hearths to their &#8220;cousins across
the sea.&#8221; The more American friends one accumulated
the more likely was one to find an American
multi-millionaire or so among them, or at
least to be by way of getting into touch with American
multi-millionaires or within &#8220;touching&#8221; distance
of them.</p>

<p>To realize to what an extent the &#8220;Anglo-Saxon
Alliance&#8221; was and is based upon this notion, one
must realize how all-powerful the upper class is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
in England, and how inarticulate, how socially, politically
and in every public way insignificant, are
the English masses, including the bulk of the
middle classes. When you speak of English public
sentiment you mean the sentiment of the London
drawing-rooms. They are filled with the governing
class, which constitutes parliaments and ministries;
they dominate the journalists, who are either
of the upper class or desperately struggling to get
into it; they also dominate the masses who have
been trained by centuries of unbroken custom to
bow before rank and title.</p>

<p>There were excellent reasons in international
politics for England&#8217;s turning favorable, friendly,
even enthusiastic eyes upon America. But there
could not have been this present passionate, personal
love, this daily and hourly working of that
toothless old saw, &#8220;blood is thicker than water,&#8221;
had there not existed a reason which appealed directly
to the personal and family self-interest of
every member of nearly every upper-class family
in England.</p>

<p>And soon the German Emperor and those about
him, all of a high and impoverishing nobility, began
to work the same trusty, but never now-a-days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
rusty, old saw about the thickness of blood and
water&mdash;are we not &#8220;Germanic,&#8221; we Americans?
But the motive which is the less with the King and
the upper classes of England is the stronger with
our tempestuous German suitor&mdash;the motive of
political, or, rather, industrial friendship. He feels
that in dining and wining and treating, &#8220;just as if
they were equals,&#8221; American owners of yachts and
multi-millionaires, he is endearing himself to the
American people. For, like practically the whole
of Europe to-day, he thinks America is no longer
a Democracy, but a thinly disguised plutocracy.
And the more he reads and hears of the power and
prestige of American multi-millionaires at home,
the more firmly is he convinced that when he is
tickling the vanity of these &#8220;dollar-swollen upstarts,&#8221;
he is sending delicious thrills up and down
the spine of the American eagle.</p>

<p>Yes, European princes and potentates are rubbing
noses and back-scratching in the friendliest,
most democratic fashion in the world, with such of
the American people as can afford to visit Europe
in royal luxury and get themselves admitted to
royal inclosures. The object of these condescensions
to our fellow-countrymen is to improve the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
relations between sundry European monarchies and
the American people. A worthy object, as is any
which has at bottom the promoting of peace on
honorable terms. But Europe is wasting energy
in misdirected effort. It assumes that these American
beneficiaries have the same &#8220;rank&#8221; at home
that similarly fortuned Europeans have in their
countries. And, not unnaturally, it is confirmed in
its false notion by many a petty success through
this courtship of snobbish plutocrats and plutocratic
diplomats.</p>

<p>The American multi-millionaire and his wife and
his son and his daughter&mdash;again this does not mean
all Europe-visiting Americans of wealth&mdash;are directly
responsible for Europe&#8217;s present opinion of
the American brand of Democracy. For they&mdash;not
unnaturally&mdash;wish to make themselves out the
relative equals of their titled and exalted friends.
They begin to &#8220;talk tall&#8221;; and, being far away
from home, they soon are thinking as tall as they
talk. They confirm each other in the idea that they
are really the &#8220;whole show&#8221; at home. They return
with retinues of caste-trained, servile domestics;
they live in colonies in our own cities into which
none but dollar-hunters and dollar-worshipers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
penetrate. The political bosses court them, give
them laws and senatorships and diplomatic posts
in exchange for campaign contributions. Their
infatuation grows apace.</p>

<p>Thus the American fresh from America finds
London&mdash;let us confine ourselves to the one capital
as typical&mdash;a strange, humorous spectacle in the
fashionable season. He can hardly believe his
own eyes and ears. A week or two, and so persistent
are the impressions of a true American nobility
visiting Europe that he almost feels that he
has been asleep with Rip Van Winkle and has
awakened to a new country and a new order in
which there is no American Republic.</p>

<p>And we are only at the beginning. The &#8220;Anglo-Saxon
Alliance&#8221; between the English upper class
and the American aspirants to be thought &#8220;upper
class,&#8221; the dragging in of the rich American pilgrim
out of the fog to the cheeriest corner of the
English fire, these are matters of yesterday. And
already Paris gets but a glance from the rich
Americans, and the most foresighted of Paris shopkeepers
are establishing London branches for the
&#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; American who no longer can spare
the time from his or her English social duties to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
make the outfitting trip across the English Channel.
To-morrow&mdash;The English hearth is large;
there is room on it for every presentable or hope-inspiring
American who can afford to cross the
Atlantic; and the news of the jollity of the London
season and of the round of English house parties
is spreading in America and is attracting the pretentious
society of all the large American cities.
The &#8220;Alliance&#8221; is indeed booming.</p>

<p>It is not through English aversion to the Atlantic
voyage that, though we are the sought, we go to
the home of the seeker to be sought. The English
upper classes would come to us if we insisted upon
it, although the item of expense looks larger to
them than to us. But we do not insist upon it.
Our &#8220;leisure class&#8221; is made far more comfortable
in England than it is at home. America has no
such facilities as has England for amusing sheer
idleness in ways that are not undisguisedly inane.
Through several centuries, the filling in of the
idle hours of professional idlers has been a study
there; the houses, the streets, the theatres, the restaurants,
the whole social system is adapted to it.</p>

<p>Further, the American can feel so &#8220;tall,&#8221; can
believe so thoroughly in his own aristocracy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
aloofness above the general run of mankind when
there are three thousand miles of barren water between
him in his grandeur and the shop where he
worked as a &#8220;clark,&#8221; or the cabin where his father
was born, or the back yard where his mother, in
gingham, hung out the wash. Thus, the Americans
in search of &#8220;the high life&#8221; for which they yearn
prefer to go to it rather than to have it brought
to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I study your countrymen here and get their
views,&#8221; said an Englishman, famous as a lifelong
admirer of America and of the democratic idea,
&#8220;I become convinced against my will that your
Democracy is dying. It seems the ideal of Democracy
is too high to survive prosperity; apparently it
can exist only in what one of your countrymen,
writing in your simple days, called the atmosphere
of plain living and high thinking. As soon as a
man becomes prosperous he begins to &#8216;put on airs,&#8217;
as you Americans say. And the pity of it is that
the less prosperous concede his superiority, and so
make his &#8216;airs&#8217; significant where they would otherwise
be ridiculous. The reason our monarchies,
that is, our monarchical governments and our aristocratic
classes, are becoming friendly to you, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
that you are becoming like them. They concede
something; but you&mdash;you concede your principles.
They get something&mdash;cash dividends on their condescensions.
But I&#8217;m blest if I can see what <i>you</i>
get.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the stay-at-home American, or, for the matter
of that, to the travelling American who retains
his sense of proportion, the exaggerating of bumptious
American &#8220;diplomats&#8221; and &#8220;dollarcrats&#8221; into a
national phenomenon of peril, and the gloomy
croakings or sardonic rejoicings in Europe over
the decay of the American Republic may seem preposterous&mdash;as
preposterous as an ambassador&#8217;s
fancying that his ecstasies when a king claps him on
the shoulder are the ecstasies of the entire American
people. But it is a phenomenon that should not,
that cannot wisely, be left out of account. Steam
and electricity have bridged the chasm across which
our ancestors fled to establish here a system based
upon sanity, simplicity and justice. And at a peculiarly
trying time there are crossing over to us
European ideas and ideals that so dangerously
disguise snobbishness and plundering and injustice
under pretentious culture and such plausible
frauds as the &#8220;natural leadership of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
classes that have demonstrated their superiority by
success.&#8221;</p>

<p>The problem is often stated cart before the
horse. &#8220;What will our plutocracy do with us?&#8221;
men say in all seriousness. The question, in fact,
is, &#8220;What shall we do with our plutocracy?&#8221; It
has descended upon us swift as a cyclone, insidious
as a plague. We had no adequate warning. We
have not yet, as a people, grasped the situation in
its fullness. Of all the cure-alls so confidently proposed
by our political and sociological quacks,
which one does not show on its very surface to any
careful mind utter futility at best, disaster in the
application as a highly probable event?</p>

<p>The plutocracy itself shares in the delusion of
so many of our &#8220;publicists.&#8221; &#8220;What shall we do
with America?&#8221; it insolently says in effect.</p>

<p>A little patience; a little time for our eighty millions,
surcharged with Democracy, to weigh and
measure and judge. Be sure, the dog will not be
wagged by the tail. And before many decades
European caste will see such a handwriting upon
the western sky as has not terrified it since our
Declaration of Independence.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> cannot, then, be denied that wealth, concentrated
wealth&mdash;not so much the plutocrat himself
as the vast masterful accumulation of which he is
the appendage; one might with truth say, the victim&mdash;is
not only the most conspicuous factor in American
life to-day, but also one of the most potent factors.
The plutocracy in politics, the plutocracy in
business, the plutocracy in society, the plutocracy in
the home&mdash;in its own homes&mdash;that is our &#8220;peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great monster indeed, fully up to the harrowing
descriptions of our radical orators and writers.
But why does the average, common-sense American
refuse to be terrified? Because he does not see it?
Hardly that. No; the real reason is that the
American is fundamentally incapable of those caste
and class feelings, without which a plutocracy can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
never hope to erect itself into an aristocracy, and
therefore a real &#8220;peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>To see America&mdash;the America that was, and is,
and shall be&mdash;we must leave the neighborhood of
the palaces of the plutocracy with its servile parasites
and imitators, its fawning menials and shopkeepers;
we must also leave the neighboring slums,
where the American is so sadly caricatured&mdash;not
more sadly, in truth, than where the plutocracy
flaunts. We must go to the smaller cities and the
towns and villages and the farms, where in ten
thousand homes a sane and sober life is led by a
sane and sober people. And we find there no tendencies
toward the development of caste, far-reaching
though the poisonous influence of the plutocracy
is.</p>

<p>For our hopeful, yes, convincing comparisons,
we need not bring forward the early days of the
republic, when the surviving silly old Colonial aristocracy
was strong enough to restrict the suffrage,
to enforce rigid class distinctions, to threaten us
with an official aristocracy of &#8220;birth.&#8221; We only
need compare forty years ago with to-day to see
the substantial progress of true Democracy. Proportionately,
are there not vastly fewer people to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
lacking that high sense of self-respect which
caused so much open, profuse and shamefaced
apologies for electing to the Presidency a man of
such &#8220;low origin&#8221; as Lincoln? At the time of the
Civil War, and even thereafter, the rich men in
every community had great political influence
simply because they were rich, and property, as
property, claimed and was conceded a right to a
more potent voice in the public affairs. Is it so
to-day? Is not the property influence exercised
only in secrecy and stealth? Is the rich man a favorite
for elective office, or are the people, roused
by the frequent coincidence of wealth and corruption,
jealously suspicious of the rich man in politics?</p>

<p>Outside the umbra and penumbra of plutocracy
we find the American with the inborn sense of
equality, the American that rejoices in humble origin
as proof of the personal worth of him who has
risen. We are still a nation of working men and
women, the sons and daughters of working people.
And just as soon as one of us becomes ashamed of
his birth or of his own past, becomes infected with
the cheap and silly vulgarisms that Europe is always
thrusting upon us, just so soon does he or she
begin to fall behind in the procession. Influential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
relatives will not long save him or her, nor inherited
property; misused opportunity to better education
will only hasten the downfall.</p>

<p>Never was country made up of more <i>kinds</i> of
people than the United States; but we have no
classes. There is no condition to which one is born
from which one may not escape. Class means such
a condition. Now, were caste altogether a matter
to be determined by the rich, by those &#8220;on top,&#8221;
we might well tremble for the future of our social
state. The rich of a thousand localities would not
be slow to take advantage of the chance were it
offered them. But fortunately <i>caste is made by
those who look up, not by those who look down</i>.</p>

<p>However many Americans there may be who
would like to look <i>down</i>, there are few, there are
ever fewer, with the quaint fancy for looking <i>up</i>. It
is true that in our so-called &#8220;foreign element&#8221; there
seems to lie the possibility of a dangerous influence.
This vast mass of foreigners, coming from lands
where class distinctions are centuries old, is regarded
with hope, consciously and unconsciously, by our
plutocratic with caste aspirations. But let us recall
the facts about that other flood of immigration, the
Irish and the Germans who came in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
part of the last century&mdash;proportionately a greater
flood than the one which has been sweeping in upon
us for the last twenty years. In the fifties of the
last century, as to-day, it was confidently predicted
that the downfall of Democracy had already begun.
The slavocracy of the South struck hands with the
then existing manufacturing plutocracy of the
North, and the basis of the Northern plutocracy
was the hordes of ignorant immigrants. What
happened? The war? More than that. Democracy
absorbed away the basis of the rising Northern
aristocracy just as the war swept away the basis of
slavocracy. The children and grandchildren of the
immigrants became the most strenuous of
Americans.</p>

<p>Our &#8220;foreign element&#8221; does not remain foreign.
It comes here to become American, and it sets about
the accomplishment of its purpose with an energy
and a resolution that are unconquerable. When
our plutocracy of to-day leans upon the &#8220;foreign
element&#8221; it leans upon a breaking reed. And the
more heavily it leans the worse will be the fall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In manners more easily than any other way can
we see Democracy in progress. There should be no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
confusing that respectful consideration for others,
which in an honest way most of us have, with the
European idea of deference. Whether at home or
abroad, the big asset of the American is his lack
of deference, his freedom from that which angered
Walt Whitman into crying out haughtily:</p>

<p>&#8220;By heaven, there has been about enough of
doffing and deprecating. I find no sweeter fat
than that which clings to my own bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manners bespeak mental attitude; and mental
attitude is the man. Americans should be careful
how they permit themselves to trifle with their
manners. We are hearing a great deal about
&#8220;growing distinctions between class and mass&#8221;
now-a-days. Many are &#8220;viewing with alarm&#8221; and
&#8220;deeply deploring&#8221; such evidences of it as, to use
the most often cited instance, the increasing tendency
of well-to-do parents to send their children to
private schools instead of, as formerly, to the public
school.</p>

<p>The viewers with alarm seem to miss the point.
It is not the &#8220;mass&#8221; that is going to suffer by this
imported passion for exclusiveness; it is the &#8220;class.&#8221;
The &#8220;class&#8221; cuts itself off from the &#8220;mass,&#8221; from
the full, strong currents of democratic life which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
alone give vitality and endurance. The mass remains
vital and energetic and progressive; the class
withers and shrivels and sloughs away.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the disposition on the part of
some Americans to despise and forsake the splendid
triumph-producing ideas of their country for
the mean and petty, disaster and decay-producing
ideas of the Old World, is a matter which should
not be passed over without comment. Of necessity
our snobs will be pushed aside and trampled in the
resistless onrush of the Democratic idea. The nation
would be feeble indeed if it could be halted or
even slackened by such an obstacle. But the snobs
ought to be noted and warned. Disobedience to
the great laws which determine the evolution of
mankind is important only to the disobedient individual.
But it is part of our humanitarian duty as
democrats to be patient with the ignorant, the weak
and the erring, and to be helpful to them as far
as we can. It is impossible for any one with the
broad sympathies which Democracy engenders not
to feel the impulses of pity when he sees fellow-beings,
through vanity or ignorance, flinging themselves
and their innocent young children across the
very pathway of the mighty wave of Democracy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>A snob is a person who feels inferior and wants
company in his misery, and longs for the consolation
of finding those even lower than himself.
Snobism should be exterminated, just as, more and
more scientifically, bodily disease is being stamped
out. The snob is the only one who wants class distinctions,
or who can encourage their existence. It
is the snob who returns from abroad deeply impressed
by courtesies shown him over there in expectation
of and in exchange for tips. He uses his
first intake of native air to fall afoul of the native
manners. And no doubt our manners do need improving.
We have always been in a great hurry
under press of work, and there is still a great deal
more to do than our competent doers can find time
for. But in polishing our manners we must be
careful to use a sound brand of democratic polish,
not the English brand so much admired by those
who yearn for a deference from others which
they would not when alone venture to show themselves.</p>

<p>Back of manners is instinct. Often a man&#8217;s
lack of manners enables us to see whether his instincts
are right or not. Aristocratic manners hide
moral and mental defects, just as whiskers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
clothes hide physical defects. What we ought to
develop is sincere manners&mdash;not the bowings and
scrapings of fear and cupidity and servility. Democratic
manners!</p>

<p>Good manners among the various kinds of public
and semi-public servants in England would not be
considered good manners here. Without disputing
the point with those admirers of the English
servant, we must insist that it would be ridiculous
for a self-respecting American citizen to grovel
and scrape and look and act &#8220;humble.&#8221; We want
no servility here, much as we would like to please
those persons who constantly feel the need of assurances
from others that they are as grand folks as
they would like to think themselves.</p>

<p>Scraping and cringing, whether in a duke or in a
domestic, are as bad manners for a human being as
are arrogance and impertinence.</p>

<p>The grotesque nature of the snob complaints
against the manners of our everyday people is striking
when one recognizes a certain criticism that can
justly be made against us. It is among so-called
well-bred people, a certain brand of them, our
snobs, that bad manners are most prevalent. For
out of them is left that on which alone good manners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
can be built&mdash;the proud, erect, democratic
spirit.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to have good manners in a
graded social system. It is extremely difficult to
have good manners in a Democracy. Any one can
easily be a snob, a looker-up and a looker-down.
But how very difficult it is to be a simple, unaffected
man or woman, considerate, courteous, looking
all other men and women straight in the eyes
and saying: &#8220;You are certainly as good as I am.
I hope I am as good as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your equal&#8221; is at the basis of democratic
bad manners. &#8220;You are my equal&#8221; is the basis of
democratic good manners.</p>

<p>Again and again in fashionable society, frequently
among those most prone to call their poorer
countrymen and women ill-mannered, there are barbarities
and repulsive lapses of good taste not
merely tolerated, but approved as marks of fashion
and refinement. For example: A rich woman gives
a cotillon, provides many thousand dollars&#8217; worth
of handsome favors. You look about the ballroom&mdash;there
sits a circle of girls, pretty and ugly
and passable, attractive and unattractive. Some are
loaded down with favors&mdash;you can hardly see their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
radiant faces for the mass of articles which testify
to their popularity.</p>

<p>Others have only a few favors, and those of the
poorest. Yet there they must sit, acting as foils for
the pretty and lucky girls who are emphasizing
their homeliness and bad luck. Their sufferings do
not show in their faces&mdash;at least not very plainly.
But they would not be human if they did not feel
the pangs of humiliated and wounded vanity at
this most conspicuous advertisement of their inferiority
in charm.</p>

<p>Yet the cotillon is regarded as the very highest
kind of refined social entertainment. And hostesses
will beam upon this sorry scene with never a
thought for the sufferings of their slighted and
wounded girl guests. In a truly refined society
would any one ever give any form of entertainment
at which there would be frank discrimination
among the guests?</p>

<p>Again, a woman gives a dinner. You go to
her house and find her receiving in a magnificent
dress and displaying hundreds of thousands of dollars&#8217;
worth of jewelry. She is far and away the
most gorgeously, the most expensively dressed person
at her dinner. She outshines all her women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
guests. In a truly sensitively refined society would
a hostess do this? Would she not rather dress
simply, even plainly? Her dinner, and its service,
should of course be the best she can provide&mdash;there
she is honoring her guests. But in her own
dress, in the one feature of her entertainment where
invidious and humiliating comparisons could be instantly
made, she would think not of gratifying her
own vanity, but of putting her guests at their ease.
And so she would save her best jewels and dresses
for places other than her own house and eyes other
than those of her own guests.</p>

<p>The kinds of grossly bad manners of which
these are fair and familiar examples would not surprise
us in Europe, where the education is narrow
and souls are shaped in pettiness and vulgarity by
class distinctions. But they would and do surprise
us in America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is one trait in our national character that
is a veritable Gibraltar against caste tendencies.
It is that passion for up-to-dateness, which is so
American, which is the cause of American progress,
which is the secret of the ever rising plane of the
comfort and intelligence of the American masses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>A European landowner or manufacturer, filled
with the spirit of conservatism, the spirit of &#8220;good
enough&#8221; and &#8220;it will do&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t destroy old
landmarks,&#8221; clings to musty and rusty antiquities,
hampers himself and his associates and neighbors,
drags and makes them drag at the wheels of advance.
With the American, how quickly is the new
building, the new machine, the new method already
improved into antiquity! Away with it! Replace
it by the latest and best. Better one big item in
the profit and loss account than steadily decreasing
profits and wages and products, and steadily increasing
losses through the triumphs of competitors.
The new, always the new! The new, always
hopeful of the new! Give the new a trial! To-day
must be better than yesterday; to-morrow will
surely be better still. That is America.</p>

<p>And this same spirit wages incessant and successful
war against caste. If the new man is the best
man we put him to the front. Does our &#8220;irreverence&#8221;
for things ancient sometimes offend a super-&aelig;sthetic
few? It is a pity they are so enraptured
by European picturesqueness of the antique that
they fail to note the European peasant bending and
groaning under the weight of the past. Does this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
disrespect for hampering tradition proclaim us
&#8220;new&#8221;? That is well. When did youth become a
calamity and a reproach? May we ever be &#8220;new,&#8221;
looking at the problems of life with hopeful young
eyes, confident that better, more beautiful things
lie in the future than past suns ever shone upon.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of stability&mdash;the stability
of the ship rotting at its wharf; the stability of the
ship, strong and steady, on its way through the
midst of the sea.</p>

<p>America is all for the latter. It abhors barnacles
and rust. And it combats monopolistic tendencies
most fiercely because, however adroitly disguised
as &#8220;communities of interest,&#8221; they promote the
stability of stagnation, blindfold the eager eyes of
competition, bribe brain and muscle to sloth, hold
up the heavy hands of sluggard and incompetent,
and discourage individual ambition and hope.
There should be no structure of any kind whatsoever,
whether national or social, which, when it has
clearly outlived its use, can be saved by sentiment
or interest or bulwarks of brainless boodle-bags.
And Democracy will have none such. Let those
who tremble for our future be calmed. As for
those who fancy they can in their own interest create<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
such structures, let them read history and learn
to laugh at their folly.</p>

<p>The principle applies to those less tangible but
more insidious structures&mdash;those ideas that would
give permanence or prominence to people because
of what some one else has been, or what they have
been in the past&mdash;structures existent only in the
minds of comparatively few, gone daft in their
love of European imitation. But we tear down too
quickly for them. While the fine building of class
distinctions is constructing, changes occur that
knock out the foundation stones.</p>

<p>An old New York &#8220;aristocrat&#8221;&mdash;his grandfather
came over in the steerage&mdash;glanced around
the Metropolitan Opera House one night not long
ago and said: &#8220;There are not a dozen families on
the list of boxholders twenty years ago that are on
that list to-day. All new people&mdash;and from heaven
knows where.&#8221; Where were the new people from?
Why, from whence this old &#8220;aristocrat&#8217;s&#8221; grandparents
came, from where his grandchildren
will be.</p>

<p>Whenever a fence is put up by any group of
people around themselves one of two things happens.
Either those inside grow terribly weary of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
their exclusiveness, and, finding that no particular
benefit seems to be coming from it, voluntarily let
down the fence; or the society-mad herd, seeing the
fence, makes a rush for it to get in. A coarse
rattling of hoofs and horns, a discovery of a loose
paling, a crash, a mad scramble, and there are
more inside than out.</p>

<p>Democracy is as much the law of our social order
as gravitation is of our physical order. Those who
don&#8217;t like it will, if they are wise, either leave the
country or adjust themselves and their children to
its conditions. For if they stay and bring up their
children out of harmony with the existing and unalterable
order, their children will be punished,
even though they themselves, through obedience in
their earlier lives, escape the worst consequences of
their folly.</p>

<p>The part of the coming generation that is trained
in Democracy is the part that will survive and prosper
and progress. The part that is bred in exclusiveness
and caste feeling is going to be bitterly discontented
and deplorably unprogressive certainly,
and in all probability, except in a few rare cases,
downright unprosperous.</p>

<p>Why do not the plutocratic &#8220;exclusives&#8221; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
aspirants to exclusiveness see these things and take
warning? Because vanity is so much stronger in
influence over the average human being than is
reason. They pile up the millions, make safe investments,
plot monopolies that will insure stability
of property, and imagine that their family line will
be secure. Then they educate their children to
folly and superciliousness and economic helplessness
or at best give them a training not in business,
in useful labor, but in the truly aristocratic chicanery
of high finance. Thus does Nature, abhorring
permanence, craftily use them for their own undoing.
Whom the gods wish to destroy they first
make drunk on the fumes of vanity.</p>

<p>The plutocracy and its imitators bring up their
children in hot-houses. Some of the youngsters are
ejected from the hot-house and exposed as soon
as they are grown&mdash;or sooner; others remain in
the hot-house and perhaps breed there. But the
day of fate comes. The hot-house is emptied or
destroyed.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the masses and their children,
fortunately for the prosperity and progress of the
race, few can build these hot-houses; only a few
can dwell in them. And with the swift progress of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
Democracy in these modern days, this cruel, mocking
favoritism swiftly decreases.</p>

<p>Manners there can be, but they must be democratic
manners. Refinement, culture, there can be,
but it must be democratic. Idealism there can be,
but it must be true idealism, broad, deep and high,
not a &#8220;class&#8221; matter, not a vanity, not a pretentious
crushing down of millions to make luxurious holiday
for a few.</p>

<p>The aristocratic idealisms in manners, education,
politics, religion, mode of life, are fleeing like
shades of night before the bright daylight of
Democracy. Only ignorance could ever have
thought them fair.</p>

<small>THE COMPELLER OF EQUALITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since the first tall chimneys unfurled the
sooty banners of the new, the industrial civilization,
we have had the cry that the power machine is a
monster whose reign means the debasement of the
masses of mankind. And latterly, throughout the
world, but most loudly in America, which has been
foremost in promoting the new order, it has been
charged that the men in control of the new order,
the business men, are merciless and relentless; that
in the struggle for markets and for profits they
are trampling morality and all the other restraints
and ideals. Now comes Thorstein Veblen, lately
Assistant Professor of Political Economy at the
University of Chicago, to formulate these charges
upon a scientific basis. In his <i>Theory of Business
Enterprise</i> he makes the following declarations of
scientific principle:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>First: That &#8220;the machine is a leveller, a vulgarizer,
whose ends seem to be the extirpation of
all that is respectable, noble and dignified in human
intercourse and ideals&#8221;; that &#8220;in the nature of
the case the cultural growth dominated by the machine
industry is of a skeptical, matter-of-fact complexion,
materialistic, unmoral, unpatriotic, undevout&#8221;;
that &#8220;the machine, their (the masses&#8217;)
master, is no respecter of persons, and knows neither
morality nor dignity, nor prescriptive right,
divine or human.&#8221;</p>

<p>Second: That &#8220;the machine methods which are
corrupting the hearts and manners of the workmen
are profitable to the business man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Third: That &#8220;the economic welfare of the community
at large is best secured by a facile and uninterrupted
interplay of the various processes which
make up the industrial system at large; but the
pecuniary interests of the business men, in whose
hands lies the discretion in the matter, are not necessarily
best served by an unbroken maintenance
of the industrial balance. Especially is this true
as regards those greater business men whose interests
are very extensive. Gain may come to them
from a given disturbance of the system, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
the disturbance makes for heightened facility or
for widespread hardship, very much as a speculator
in grain futures may be either a bull or a bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fourth: That, these being the facts, there has
arisen a &#8220;class of pecuniary experts&#8221; who &#8220;have
an interest in making the disturbances of the system
large and frequent&#8221;; that, under the new civilization,
industry being carried on for business, and
not business for the sake of industry, such disturbances
are as a matter of fact both large and frequent,
are incident to a merciless struggle among
business men for the supremacy which monopoly
alone gives; that, while the business man, in common
with other men, is moved by humane ideals,
&#8220;motives of this kind detract from business efficiency,
and an undue yielding to them on the part
of business men is to be deprecated as an infirmity&#8221;;
that, while sentiment has a certain force &#8220;in restraint
upon pecuniary advantage, not in abrogation
of it,&#8221; the &#8220;code of business ethics consists,
after all, of mitigations of the maxim, <i>caveat
emptor</i> (let the buyer beware)&#8221;; that, &#8220;under the
system of handicraft and neighborhood industry,
the adage &#8216;Honesty is the best policy&#8217; seems, on the
whole, to have been accepted and to have been true.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
This adage has come down from the days before
the machine&#8217;s r&eacute;gime and before modern business
enterprise&#8221;; that, under modern circumstances of
lack of personal contact between business man and
customer, &#8220;business management has a chance to
proceed on a temperate and sagacious calculation of
profit and loss, untroubled by sentimental considerations
of human kindness or irritation or of
honesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Veblen&#8217;s ideas have been given in his
own language so far as has been permitted by his
passionate professorial predilection for polysyllables&mdash;or,
has he used long words and involved
phrases from the prudent motive of screening from
&#8220;the vulgar&#8221; the ferocity of his attack upon business
men, rather than from the reactionary motive
of scholastic snobbery? However this may be, to
close study he makes it clear enough that, according
to his reading of political economy:</p>

<p>First: The machine is a monster.</p>

<p>Second: It is making monsters of men&mdash;brutal
serfs of the masses; bandits, liars, thieves and
cheats of the managers and directors.</p>

<p>A savage indictment that! A terrifying, topsy-turvying
of the dearest beliefs and hopes of us who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
look upon steam and electricity as efficient agents
of Democracy, the strong and inevitable unshacklers
of the bodies and minds of mankind. But
Professor Veblen has stated only the extreme of
what is said without denial every day; he is simply
the courageous spokesman of the majority of the
classes who write and speak; he is putting into
scientific formula the sneer of every snob who professes
contempt of business and, indeed, of all other
forms of modern democratic activity. His book,
therefore, serves admirably as a provocation for
presenting a few facts and suggestions on the other
side.</p>

<p>Is it true, either in whole or in part, that our
industrial civilization is degrading the masses into
mere appurtenances of the machine, mere mechanical
aids to the heaping up of vast profits in the
treasuries of the few? Is it true, either in whole
or in part, that our business men, whether great or
small, whether captains of industry or sub-officers,
are degenerating into dishonesty and the short-sighted
selfishness of the slave-master?</p>

<p>A surface survey of our time reveals much that
seems to compel a reluctant affirmative answer. To
glance at a newspaper is to read of the cynical tyrannies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
of beef, oil, coal, iron, grain, railway magnates,
who make their infamies nauseating by ardent
professions of patriotism and piety. And
from time to time the shameless adulterations of
food and drink culminate in some sensational
slaughter of people wholesale, suggesting vastly
greater slaughters effected quietly from day to day.</p>

<p>And we see persons grown enormously rich upon
stolen privileges of various kinds exhibiting themselves
in luxurious ostentation, offering tempting
rewards to sycophancy and pauperizing those fighting
on the poverty line by supercilious gifts and
condescensions. We see rascality rewarded with
wealth and honors, success bought with self-sale.
We see corruption, conspicuous and hideous, everywhere
upon the surface of the social body. And we
turn away heartsick, convinced that the Veblens
have stated the truth with moderation.</p>

<p>But if we turn away to read history&mdash;not the
fables and fancies, the poetical romances and romantic
poems from which the Veblens draw their
&#8220;facts,&#8221; but the true story of the mankind that was&mdash;if
we read that painful recital, we turn again to
the mankind of our day, and it is like a landscape
from which the storms of winter are rolling away.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
The corruption which revolted us is still there, just
as hideous as before; but we now see that it is the
poison which was working in the veins and arteries
of the patient and is now at the surface, on its way
out of the body before the victorious legions of
health.</p>

<p>Professor Veblen, and his like, are prone to use,
in writing and speaking, words of many meanings;
they unconsciously play upon these words, and so
fall into grievous error. For instance, Professor
Veblen talks of ours as a &#8220;machine&#8221; civilization&mdash;as
if the machine were its new and characteristic
factor, determining its form and its destiny. In fact,
civilization from its very inception has been &#8220;machine-made.&#8221;
It began when our remotest ancestor
snatched the bough of a tree and decided thenceforth
to walk erect, using the bough as staff and
club&mdash;that is, as a machine. Every tool of every
kind has been a machine; and the progress of the
race has been determined by the number and efficiency
of its machines, both those designed to compel
peace and those designed to further the arts of
peace. If you wish to measure the actual value of
any civilization&mdash;value in producing healthy minds
in healthy bodies&mdash;you need only inquire into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
kind and number and efficiency of its machines.
Why? Because the machine represents the effort
of man to adjust himself to his environment, his
environment to himself. It gives power to him,
whoever he may be, that learns to use it; it leaves
him who does not avail himself of its aid, whether
through idleness or ignorance or intemperance or
incapacity, about where he would have been&mdash;certainly
no worse off than he would have been&mdash;had
mankind remained in the helpless, machineless
&#8220;state of nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evolution has so unevenly affected the human
race that, fortunately for us in the foremost files of
progress, we need not rely upon history and cautious
conjecture for our encouraging and inspiring
knowledge of the world of the past, which enables
us to see how far and how high we have got, and
that the journey is still swiftly, if steeply, upward.
There is hardly a stage of human progress that is
not now represented on the earth, inviting any man
with a passion for the &#8220;glorious past,&#8221; to disillusionize
himself and cheer his pessimism. And we
are enabled easily to reconstruct any period of the
past. Thus, we have visual confirmation of the
truth about Athens which history can only suggest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
We know that the Athens of Plato and Praxiteles
was no more the true Athens than is the intellect
and tradition of Booker Washington a true type
of the intelligence and condition of the overwhelming
mass of our eight million negroes. We come
to understand what Athens&#8217; twenty-five thousand
free citizens and many hundred thousand slaves
really meant; we penetrate into the profligacy of
the Athenian rich, the degradation of the Athenian
masses; we realize why Aristides was banished for
being just and Alcibiades carried on the shoulders
of the Athenian Democracy (!) because he was a
degenerate and a debauchee. And so on through
all the past.</p>

<p>In like manner, we need not rely upon the poets
and poetical historians, as Professor Veblen apparently
does, for knowledge of what the &#8220;handicraft&#8221;
civilization meant. We can study it, as it survives
practically unchanged in the miserable hovels of
Bohemian and Italian and Spanish peasants, where
men and beasts rot together in conditions of sanitation
that would not long be tolerated in any place
where the &#8220;machine civilization&#8221; has inaugurated
its high and ever higher moral and physical standards.
We need not go so far from home. To get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
a picture of a prosperous handicraft city of the
middle ages, go to New York&#8217;s East Side, where
are the fast disappearing sweatshops that were
transplanted from &#8220;handicraft neighborhoods&#8221; of
Europe. The poets have it otherwise; and so do
those historians who like to paint alluring pictures
for their readers&mdash;and hate to grub for facts. But
there is the grisly truth. Contrast the average
sweatshop with the average factory. No; contrast
the best sweatshop with the worst factory.</p>

<p>Partly because some men are so much shrewder
and more persistent and more far-sighted than the
masses of their fellows, but chiefly because the
mass of mankind has not been long enough emancipated
by the power of the machine to learn how to
work intelligently and efficiently, the power machine,
become enormously beneficent through steam
and electricity, has not yet done all, or even more
than a very small part, of what it can do, and shall
do, for mankind. But already&mdash;in less than ten
decades, less than seven&mdash;what a forward stride!
In place of a world where all but a handful toiled
early and late&mdash;from dawn until far into the night&mdash;toiled
that others might reap all and they only
blows and the meagre bread of bitterness, we now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
have a world where millions upon millions are comfortable.
And as for the masses and toilers still
in the shackles of the old r&eacute;gime, are they not
better off than they were under that r&eacute;gime where
wages were alms, and alms of the scantiest; where
the only lights in the black darkness of utter
ignorance were the will-o&#8217;-the-wisps of Superstition,
drawing man farther and farther into the morass
of slavery to king and noble and priest?</p>

<p>In writing works on political economy, professors
should not study the conditions of labor before
steam and electricity in poems and romances and
from orchestra stalls at productions of &#8220;Die Meistersinger.&#8221;
There is not a serf toiling in the deepest
depth of the most hell-like mine in Siberia, upon
whose shoulders, and upon whose soul, the burden
is not lighter for the modern expansion of the
civilization of the machine.</p>

<p>The truth is, steam and electricity have made the
human race suddenly and acutely self-conscious as
a race for the first time in its existence. They have
constructed a mighty mirror wherein humanity sees
itself, with all its faults and follies, and diseases
and deformities. And the sudden, unprecedented
spectacle is so startling, is in such abhorrent contrast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
with poetical pictures of the past, painted in
school and popular text-books, that men of defective
perspective shrink, and shriek: &#8220;Mankind
has become monstrous!&#8221; But not so. Man, rising,
rising, rising through the ages, is not nearer to
the dark and bloody and cruel place of his origin
than to the promised land toward which his ideals
are drawing him. His diseases and deformities are
of the past; and virtues that were, up to a few
decades ago, almost unattainable ideals, are now
so nearly a part of his natural adornment that hope
of the nearness of the luminous penumbra of the
Golden Age seems not unjustified.</p>

<p>What our grandfathers regarded as the natural
and just demands of employer upon employ&eacute; are
now regarded as rigorous and tyrannous exactions
of a brute. And in trying still to continue such
exactions men slink behind the lawyer-constructed
shield of the corporation, that they may be easier
in conscience by trying to believe they are not &#8220;personally&#8221;
responsible.</p>

<p>This brings us, naturally, to the charges against
business men.</p>

<p>Professor Veblen does not, in so many words,
assert that there was a time when business men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
were in business with other motives&mdash;presumably
idealistic&mdash;more potent than profits. But he forces
his readers to infer that this was the case&mdash;and that
lofty view is always taken by the assailants of our
present civilization. That is, man used to be an
altruistic animal; Democracy and the machine&mdash;for
you will find that these assailants are always
hitting at Democracy over the shoulders of the
machine&mdash;have made him a selfish and cruel rascal.</p>

<p>False weights were found in the ruins of the
oldest city that has yet been exhumed. And false
weights will probably be consumed when the earth
drops into the sun and the heavens are rolled together
like a scroll. Ancient records and ancient
statute books are full of evidence that every new
plundering device&mdash;from capitalistic and labor monopolies,
secret rebates and majority owners swindling
minority owners, down to adulterations and
crooked scales&mdash;was familiar to our ancestors of
the plateau of Iran before the migrations. Vice
is the old inhabitant; virtue is the newcomer, the
immigrant, received with reluctance and compelled
to fight for every inch of ground he gains. As for
specific testimony as to past ages, we have the testimony
of all the old writers that the mercantile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
classes, the business men, were &#8220;without honor,&#8221;
mean of soul, oppressors of their employ&eacute;s, robbers
of their customers. We happen to know, also,
that as for the other classes&mdash;the proud kings and
haughty nobles and the rest&mdash;they certainly had a
very quaint interpretation of that word &#8220;honor&#8221;
when a murderer, a tyrant, a gambler, a practitioner
of every vice that rots its slave and ruins its
victims could yet be a &#8220;gentleman of unsullied
honor.&#8221; And we know, finally, that only with the
rise of the business men to influence and authority
did the standard of honor become what all the
world now recognizes as &#8220;ideal.&#8221; The very Biblical
phrases in which honesty is enjoined are altogether
commercial, are the language of the business
world, of business men.</p>

<p>There are two vital facts about our new industrial
civilization which its critics neglect:</p>

<p>First&mdash;It has created an unprecedented and infinitely
great number of opportunities to dishonesty
of the kinds that are, to as yet but slightly
enlightened human nature, potently tempting.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;It has created new conditions of the
moral, as well as of the material, relations of man
to the masses of his fellow-men which are as yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
imperfectly understood and constitute a debatable
ground for even the fairest and rigidest consciences.
Men now see that large action of any kind involves
large evil as well as large good; and the balance of
right and wrong is not easy to adjust, except in the
tranquil studies of critics and theorists.</p>

<p>To the first of these two facts may justly be attributed
the unquestionably large amount of dishonesty&mdash;dishonesty
clearly and generally recognized
as such. To the second of these two facts
is undoubtedly due the most of the wrong-doing
by men who in their private relations are above
reproach. These statements are not put forward
to justify men for yielding to temptation to dishonesty
and to justify men in acts, approval of
which can be got from conscience by sophistry only,
if at all. They are put forward simply to explain
why it is that, when there are actually more honesty
and conscientiousness, and they of a higher quality,
than ever before in human history, there should be
a seeming of more dishonesty and consciencelessness.
Further in support of the same view, while
wrongdoers of the past were hidden or veiled by
the imperfect means of publicity, wrongdoers of
to-day are at once searched out and pilloried by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
the press and by public opinion. Up to the middle
of the last century men knew little of the large evil
done them, and that little imperfectly; now, knowledge
of individual acts of uprightness, once scattered
everywhere by being immortalized in tradition,
rhymed and prose, is lost in the vast revelations
of huge and ancient wrongs persisting.</p>

<p>It is no new thing for a man to be admired and
envied for wealth and station, regardless of how
he got them. But it is a new thing in the world
for the public conscience to be so sensitive that a
man in possession of wealth or station, got not by
outright and open robbery&mdash;methods not long ago
regarded without grave disapproval&mdash;but by
means that are questionable and suspicious merely,
should be in an apologetic attitude, should feel
called upon to defend himself and to give large
sums in philanthropy in the effort to justify and to
rehabilitate himself. Steam and electricity have
given to man a sudden, vast power. It is not
strange that he should commit errors and crimes
in working out its unfamiliar possibilities. It is
not strange that abuses, as old as the selfish struggle
for existence, should succeed in adapting themselves
to the new conditions, should contrive to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
persist. But is it not strange that professors of
political economy, supposedly familiar with the
truth about the past, should be so narrow and
twisted in historic and psychological perspective
as to misunderstand these simple phenomena? And
what must we think of them if, in support of their
pessimistic and unwarranted jeremiads, they conjure
the fantastic and preposterous and long-exploded
myth of humanity&#8217;s past Golden Age?</p>

<p>According to Professor Veblen, honesty is no
longer the best <i>policy</i>. What an incredible misreading
of the very sign-board of our time! Under
the old r&eacute;gime of priest or soldier or prince, honesty
was distinctly not the best policy. Strategy,
dexterity, chicane, finesse, sophistry, cozening&mdash;these
were the sure, the only ways to preferment.
For, under those r&eacute;gimes preferment meant securing
the right to live without work upon the toil of
others. And, to confine ourselves to the mercantile
classes, was not the successful business man he who
got from prince or priest or tyrant the right to
rob the people, he who got a monopoly or a license
or a concession?</p>

<p>How is it under the new r&eacute;gime, the democratic,
the &#8220;vulgarizing&#8221; r&eacute;gime of the business man?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
Our chief troubles come from survivals into the
present of the tenacious roots of the past&#8217;s methods
to success, come from the persistence of the idea
that by wit and not by wisdom and justice does the
truly strong man truly prevail. But slowly&mdash;and
surely!&mdash;the &#8220;vulgar&#8221; r&eacute;gime is enforcing the laws
and sanctions of &#8220;vulgar&#8221; morality. Even our
robber barons demand honesty, strict honesty,
among themselves in their conspiracies to monopolize
to their own profit the benefits intended for all.
When they violate the law of honesty, they do it in
secrecy and make haste to deny their crime and to
return to their allegiance to the law. Honesty is
the very ground upon which a commercial civilization
must rest. That our business men are, as a
class, and with rare exceptions, honest, keeping
their bargains, giving and receiving the value
agreed upon, is proved beyond question by the fact
that we as a nation prosper, that our abject poverty
is almost confined to newly arrived immigrants and
to our only recently emancipated negroes.</p>

<p>Where a prince is armed with power arbitrarily
to suspend the natural laws governing the intercourse
of human beings, lies and dishonesty may,
for a time, prosper; but not where the sole basis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
of intercourse is the voluntary belief of men in each
other&#8217;s integrity. And more than ninety per cent.
of our business is done upon credit! Under the old
order, the very laws and customs, the very morality
taught by the church, was grounded upon the justice
of the unjust distribution of the products of
labor; under the new r&eacute;gime, under &#8220;business enterprise,&#8221;
law and custom and religion teach only
value for value received.</p>

<p>Professor Veblen does well to criticise the misguided
attempts of philanthropy and so-called
charity to restore the old relations of superior and
inferior. But his criticism that they are insufficient
and not in keeping with the &#8220;machine civilization&#8217;s&#8221;
merciless demand for economic efficiency
does not go far enough. They are also unnecessary,
and in large measure productive of greater
ills&mdash;of pauperism and dependence&mdash;than those
they seek to mitigate. The ills are not machine-created.
They are inherent in the imperfect nature
of man. They will tend wholly to disappear only
when the machine&#8217;s &#8220;merciless&#8221; demand for
efficiency is rigidly enforced. For, what is that
&#8220;merciless&#8221; demand? What does the machine say
to man? It says, &#8220;Work is not a curse, but a blessing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
In a leisure class the only culture is of the
germs of profligacy, superciliousness, snobbery and
decay. All men must work, and must learn to work
well. All men must serve that they may pay for
service rendered. And where that order prevails,
to the worker will come the full reward for his
work. I, the machine, will make your burden into
a blessing, your toil into labor, the noble, the dignified,
the producer of civilization and self-respect.
I will widen your horizon until you see that all men
are brothers, brothers in the business of, by business
enterprise, increasing and creating wants, and of,
by business enterprise, satisfying them. I will give
you ideals that are true and just&mdash;not loyalty to
idle, thieving prince, not slavery to irrational superstition,
not bondage to bloody soldier-tyrant, but
intelligent loyalty to truth and justice and progress.
I will make you master of nature and of yourself,
servant of the true religion and the true morality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Until now has been reserved the inquiry into how
it happens that these critics of industrialism fall
into their fatal errors. That inquiry will not long
detain us. Professor Veblen na&iuml;vely gives himself
and his fellow-critics away. He confesses why he
hates the r&eacute;gime of the business man, what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
means when he calls the machine industry &#8220;materialistic,
unmoral, undevout.&#8221; &#8220;Business life,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;does not further the growth of manners and
breeding, pride of caste, punctilios of honor or even
religious fervor.&#8221; And he finds his hope for the
future in militarism and imperialism&mdash;which he,
by the way, unjustly charges to the business men
instead of to the politicians pandering to the still
lively passions of man&#8217;s inheritance from the past
when all the world was militaristic and imperialistic.
&#8220;There can be no serious question,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;but that a consistent return to the ancient virtues
of allegiance, piety, servility, graded dignity, class
prerogatives, and prescriptive authority would
greatly conduce to popular content and to the facile
management of affairs.&#8221; Nor does he conceal under
the ponderous sarcasm lurking in that statement
the truth of his own fixed belief in at least
a measure of those &#8220;ancient virtues.&#8221; For his
whole book, and the speeches and writings of practically
all the critics of industrialism, show that
these critics abhor the new virtues as &#8220;materialistic.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motive in the mind of each critic is a little
different from that of his fellow-critics. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
wishes college professors and the like to be in control;
another is for the supremacy of birth; another
for the supremacy of culture, whatever that may
mean. Another wants the preacher back at the
helm, with mankind an open-mouthed, uncritical
congregation. Each wants the particular class or
condition to which he himself has the good fortune
to belong, to have the chief say in affairs. But
all agree in denouncing the business man who is
actually in control&mdash;and will remain there. They
profess to despise money, yet they hate him for his
profits. They profess to prefer the intellectual and
moral dividends which their own intellectual and
moral enterprises declare; yet their dainty fingers
twitch for the material dividends which his material
enterprises naturally declare. They would
deny him the gains which are the only&mdash;and, as
they loudly profess, the poor enough&mdash;rewards for
wasting his life upon the gross and sordid things.</p>

<p>The business man&mdash;and that means the worker,
the &#8220;toiler&#8221;&mdash;is in control, is there to stay, because
the human animal is so constituted that its material
affairs&mdash;proper food, proper clothing, proper shelter&mdash;must
always be primal. Not of the <i>highest</i> importance,
but of the <i>first</i> importance. And if those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
material matters are well attended to&mdash;as they will
be when the worker&#8217;s instinct pervades the whole
race&mdash;the spiritual matters, the growth of body and
soul, must inevitably prosper. The worker, the
worker&#8217;s instinct, provides the right soil for a soul
to grow in&mdash;a real soil, full of the natural and
nourishing substances, not a fanciful, unsubstantial
soil of false ideals, fraudulent culture and barren
fiddle-faddle of closet theorizings.</p>

<p>For proof that the business instinct will provide
the right soil we need only point to our own country
as it is. In America, the great business nation
of the nations, there lives a race of idealists, eighty
millions earnest, dominated by the instincts for
self-help and helpfulness to others, afire with the
passion for improvement, for education, for knowledge
of all kinds and from any and all sources.</p>

<p>The world has wandered in the swamps of vain
and sentimental imaginings long enough. By all
means, let us have it established on the firm ground
and in the straight, upward roads of science and
business. The sun shines upon those roads by day,
the moon and the stars light them by night; the
flowers bloom beside them&mdash;and within reach of
the humblest wayfarer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>This gospel will not be attractive to <i>poseurs</i> and
to the lazy and the incompetent. But it is gospel,
the gospel of Democracy, America&#8217;s gospel. In
the cargo of merchandise, Enlightenment and Democracy
always travel as stowaway missionaries;
when the cargo is landed, they go ashore and begin
to preach.</p>

<small>DEMOCRACY&#8217;S DYNAMO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Education</span> is the huge dynamo which supplies
power to the American people. Not in history or
in legend is there recorded such an outburst of international
curiosity as that about the real America,
as distinguished from the America created in the
minds of Europeans by our multi-millionaires, since
it became not merely agricultural but also an industrial
world-factor, inevitably dominant in an era
whose civilization is the first based upon peace and
indissolubly wedded to peaceful arts. Europe has
not been satisfied with inspecting what comes to
her. Such specimens only whetted her curiosity
to an edge as fine as that which cut the home ties
of adventurous spirits when Columbus exhibited
his Indians and his gold at the court of his patrons.</p>

<p>The Europeans, and the Asiatics, too, hastened
to dispatch to us all manner of commissioners, semi-official<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
and private, from princes of reigning houses
to delegates from labor unions. And each of these
spies&mdash;of the splendid modern kind&mdash;has been
charged to seek and find and forthwith bring home
an answer to the all-important question: &#8220;How <i>do</i>
they do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>And these gentlemen have peeked and poked
and peered in the friendliest, most flattering way
imaginable. They have examined palace and tenement
and cottage, and their tenants. They have
eaten and drunk of all the products of the land,
and have listened to speeches numerous and have
read newspapers numberless. They have watched
wheels go round in factories&mdash;and in heads as well.
They have heard those who say &#8220;the captains of
industry did it,&#8221; those who say &#8220;it was done in
spite of the captains of industry and the high
financiers.&#8221; And after tasting and seeing and
smelling and touching and hearing, from Maine to
the Golden Gate, these envoys have gone back, and
with one accord have replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;They do it by education.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the end of the Civil War&mdash;an interruption
of our progress to rid ourselves of a drag upon it&mdash;we
have been educating as we never did before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
as no other people ever did or now does. Immigrants
have poured in; our great &#8220;infant industry&#8221;
which protectionist and free trader alike believe in
protecting and fostering, has been exceedingly expansive.
And we have put home and foreign product
into the great educational plant&mdash;from half to
two-thirds of all between five years old and twenty
going through school and academy and college.
The average annual number who now receive
formal education is one-fifth of our total population.
And more than a million of our young men
and women&mdash;one in every ten of both sexes of the
higher education age, one in every six young men
of that age&mdash;are annually in the universities, colleges,
academies, business and professional schools.
Not enough, not nearly enough; but in hopeful proportion
to what used to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, therefore I am,&#8221; runs the Descartes
formula. We teach our youth to think in order
that they may really <i>be</i>&mdash;be individual, be proud
and self-respecting and self-reliant, be free with
the freedom no government or law can give or secure,
or take away. In the educational institutions
this impulse gets form and direction that it may
develop efficient manhood. And against the thinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
toiler all the forces of ignorance and passion
and wasteful luxury, of base and foolish political,
social, industrial ideas, cannot prevail.</p>

<p>The first free school opened on these shores was
in New York City on Manhattan Island. Of all
the settlers who came to America the Dutch alone
understood and believed in the free public school,
offering free education not as alms but as a right.
They had had it at home. They established it here,
and set the example which was followed by the
other colonists, first of all by those New Englanders
who had lived in the Holland that fought
Alva and Philip, and had there absorbed some
democratic ideas. Holland was the godmother of
modern Democracy, was the nursery of the modern
public school.</p>

<p>These words are from the pen of John of Nassau,
the oldest brother of that friend of civil and
religious liberty, William the Silent:</p>

<p>&#8220;Soldiers and patriots thus educated (in free
schools) are better than all armies, arsenals, armories,
munitions, alliances and treaties that can
be had or imagined in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those words, written three hundred years ago
by a man who had devoted his life to the study of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>
the rights and wrongs of the common man, sum
up the whole story. How his eloquent common
sense contrasts with the shrieking of those little
Americans who think that a cannon shot can penetrate
further than a noble idea! How this old
friend of freedom rebukes the puny, alleged statesmen
who fancy that the manhood of this republic
was developed on the battlefields, instead of realizing
that military prowess is only one matter-of-course
evidence of its existence! Enlightenment
and Democracy make men who <i>live</i> for their country&mdash;and
that is the new force in the world.</p>

<p>Let the people who fear for the future of the
democratic spirit of this people look upon the spectacle
of our free schools, those millions of young
heads bent over books, those millions of young
brains learning to think, to reason, learning to use
mind and body in the service of civilization, real
civilization. Enlightenment has won all the victories
of the republic in the past. Its eternal warfare
upon ignorance and incompetence, upon craft
of plutocrat and craft of demagogue, and plausible
idealism of reactionary, is the safeguard of the
republic&#8217;s future. And one of the great agents of
enlightenment, of Democracy&mdash;not the only great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>
agent, not the greatest agent&mdash;is formal education
in school, academy and college.</p>

<p>And more important even than the formal education
of the boys is the formal education of the
girls. The other means to enlightenment are more
accessible to the men&mdash;indeed, they compel the men
to become less ignorant and less prejudiced in spite
of themselves. But to reach the women, the formal
education is almost indispensable, for their ignorance
and their prejudice are more sheltered, less
open to the light of Democracy that floods the
arenas and the market places.</p>

<p>And educated, enlightened, democratic women
are of the highest importance to America, whose
mission seems to be to lead the world in the march
upward to that Arcady where every human unit
shall have the chance to count as one.</p>

<p>Our extensive and our expanding system of
higher education of women is often bitterly assailed
by educated men, by educators. Bourbonism, especially
when bulwarked by vanity, does not yield
easily. And it will be many a day before death
reaps the last man with the passion for looking
down on his fellow-creatures. To avoid useless
dispute, admit that woman should look up to man.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
Still there remains unimpaired the truth that woman&#8217;s
two highest functions are to be the companion
of man and the mother of men. The profitable
companion for an educated man must be an educated
woman&mdash;educated not merely for man&#8217;s
&#8220;hours of ease,&#8221; nor for his happily infrequent
hours &#8220;when pain and anguish rack the brow,&#8221; but
also for the hours of development and endeavor.</p>

<p>So long as so-called education consisted in a little
Latin and less Greek, forgotten as speedily as the
business of life could crowd it from the mind,
higher education was as unimportant to women as&mdash;well,
as it was to man. But now that education
consists in teaching not how the Greeks and Romans
lived, but how &#8220;you and I&#8221; must live to-day
and to-morrow, the gap between the man who has
had the higher education and the woman who has
not had it and has not supplied the deficiency, is
wide indeed and will grow wider. If as much attention
were given to the relations between men and
women from five years after marriage on to the
end as is given to their relations during the purely
sentimental and transitory mating season this difference
would appear in its true importance.</p>

<p>The same point of view applies to woman as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
mother. So long as the training of children centred
around the slipper and the switch, an ignorant
mother was not at a great disadvantage&mdash;the best
educated mothers knew little. But now-a-days the
child of the highly educated mother has an enormous
advantage, other things being equal, because
such a mother applies science to the conduct of her
home as her husband applies it to the conduct of
his profession or business.</p>

<p>No education in the mother will compensate for
lack of character. Character without education is
infinitely better than education without character.
But character plus education is the true ideal&mdash;and
it is attainable.</p>

<p>If we are speedily to enter more fully into the
rich promised land which Democracy opens to us,
we must have not only the man who knows but the
woman who knows. After all, is not our ultimate
excuse for being alive that we are the parents of
the next generation? And there the woman, with
practically absolute control over the next generation
at its vital, formative age, has the better of the
man. If anything, does she not need the higher
education more than does the man?</p>

<p>Education for the men; education for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
women. But it must be <i>enlightened and enlightening</i>
education.</p>

<p>Our national ideal is not a powerful state, famed
and feared for bluster and appetite, not a people
welded by unthinking passion for military glory
into an instrument to the greed and vanity of the
few; but manhood and womanhood, a citizenship
ever wiser and stronger and more civilized, with
ever more and more individual units that cannot
be controlled in the mass&mdash;the democratic man and
the democratic woman&mdash;alert, enlightened, self-reliant,
free.</p>

<p>Now, there can be no difference of opinion as to
the way to this ideal, the way to make the individual
capable to work out his own salvation without
hindrance from the aggressiveness of his neighbor
or neighbors, without hindrance from the prejudices
begotten in and of the darkness of his own
ignorance.</p>

<p>Against all these foes, those without, those
within, there is just one effective weapon&mdash;education.</p>

<p>It is impossible for an ignorant man to be free.
No matter what constitutions you establish, no matter
what laws you pass, no matter how assiduously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
you safeguard individual rights and liberties,
the ignorant man will still be a slave. He rejoices
in his chains, his prejudices and his superstitions.
He clings to them. He beats off those who seek
to deliver. He welcomes those who seek to bind.
He shouts for chains, he votes for chains&mdash;chains
for himself, chains for others. If he is ever in the
right it is because he is mistaken. And you may
be certain that a demagogue or other slave-hunter
will soon recapture him and restore him to his beloved
bondage of error.</p>

<p>This is why the man who aspires to freedom
instinctively reaches for the weapon of education.
This is why the American people always have had
as their dominant passion the passion for education.
This is why on the frontier the schoolhouse
is finished before the home is furnished; why the
washerwoman and the drayman toil to keep their
children in school and to send at least one son to
college; why our self-made men pour out their
wealth in educational endowments; why there are
all these colossal public appropriations for schools,
academies, colleges, universities.</p>

<p>What is an ignorant man?</p>

<p>Of course there are the illiterates and the almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
illiterate. But, numerous though they are, they do
not count for much in this republic. They do not
decide elections. They do not select candidates.
They do not propose and compel legislation. The
so-called ignorant vote is not a national or a local
peril. It is not a national, rarely even a local
factor.</p>

<p>The ignorance that counts in a Democracy is
educated ignorance. Sometimes it has only been
part of the way through the common schools.
Sometimes it has one or more university degrees.
Sometimes it struts and preens itself as &#8220;the scholar
in politics.&#8221; Only too often it writes books, especially
histories, and in the magazines and in the
newspapers tells how and for whom we ought to
vote. More often than not the very conspicuous
members of this ignorant class are full to the overflowing
with knowledge, knowledge from books,
knowledge from experience, knowledge from
travel.</p>

<p>No, education&mdash;democratic education&mdash;is not
knowledge. It is not even experience. Profound,
deadly, dangerous ignorance is compatible with
both.</p>

<p>What, then, is ignorance?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>All its shades and kinds can be so classified as
to exclude none who ought to be included, include
none who has the right to go free. Is not the
dangerous, ignorant man of the Democracy the
man who cannot reason, cannot think for himself?</p>

<p>What does it mean to think for one&#8217;s self?</p>

<p>Fortunately, it does not mean original thinking.
If that were so there would instantly arise in the
world the most contracted and exclusive aristocracy
it has ever known. To think for one&#8217;s self does not
even mean correctly to reason out one&#8217;s own conclusions
from given premises. That would involve
an amount of mental labor from which many brains
might shrink. It merely means to be able to follow
reasoning that is laid before one; to hear both sides
and suspend judgment until both are heard; to
recognize which is sound and which fallacious, and
upon that independent and clear judgment to accept
the true, or rather, to reject the false.</p>

<p>A Democracy must breed citizens who think for
themselves. Without them it cannot live. With
them it cannot die. Hence it follows that in a
Democracy education means to cultivate the ability
to think for one&#8217;s self. Democracy means the right
of private judgment. Education in and for a Democracy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>
means development of the capacity to
form private judgment.</p>

<p>So far as the Democracy is concerned, so far as
the equable distribution of rights and liberties is
concerned, no education that does not increase reasonableness
is of the slightest value.</p>

<p>The education that has for its chief aims, its
only real aims, culture, refinement, knowledge,
learning, may be useful to an aristocracy like Great
Britain, to an empire like Germany, to an autocracy
like Russia. But it is not only not helpful to but
actually hostile to democratic ideas and ideals. It
breeds contempt on the one hand, fear and suspicion
and hate on the other&mdash;the few looking down
upon the many, the many looking up at the few.
It makes the powerful supercilious. It makes the
weak, whether educated or uneducated, helpless.
It fills the brain; it does not necessarily strengthen
the brain. It <i>gives</i> a man something; it does not
compel him to make something of himself.</p>

<p>The truth about democratic education is indirectly
recognized in practice more and more as
science and its rigidly logical methods have grown
in educational importance. All our modern systems
of education are based perforce, rather than by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span>
design, in part upon teaching the brain to reason.
But do we realize fully as yet that for us, for our
democratic purposes of self-development and self-government,
teaching the brain to think is not only
the whole foundation of education, but also the sustaining
part of the superstructure?</p>

<p>Take up any one of the great newspapers of the
country, the great reflectors of the public mind and
heart and taste. A few minutes&#8217; searching among
the advertisements will discover columns on columns
of notices of astrologers and palmists and
clairvoyants, of mediums and crystal gazers and
cure-all doctors with their cure-all medicines. To
whom do these dealers in the secrets of life and
death, the future and the beyond, appeal for their
comfortable incomes? To those who cannot read?
Manifestly not. To the people in the humbler
walks of life? Certainly not. No, they are inviting
the educated classes to call&mdash;merchants and
bankers and artisans, their wives and their daughters,
the &#8220;well-to-do,&#8221; the reading public, the &#8220;substantial,&#8221;
the part of the people which is commonly
called &#8220;the backbone of the republic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Go on to the news columns. You find some
account of the doings of a band of thieves who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
have got possession of some department or departments
of the city or state government, and have
substituted for the statute law the law of loot.
Who turned over the keys to them? The illiterate,
the dishonest, the criminal? Not at all. Look at
the primary rolls of the organization whom these
wretches disgrace, and you find a thoroughly respectable,
in the main intelligent, certainly honest,
body of voters. By no stretch of the meaning could
you call them uneducated in the sense in which that
term is commonly used.</p>

<p>In the very next column, perhaps, you read how
a statesman of pious mien and impressive manner
has been assuring his fellow-countrymen that they
have a commission from the Almighty (which he
begs leave to execute) calling them from their
peaceful and orderly occupations and sending them
forth to slaughter certain other men of whom they
had not heard until a few months ago, to seize
persons and property and to administer upon them
arbitrarily. And who cheered wildly as these tidings
of morality and civilization were proclaiming?
Illiterates? Certainly not; but educated men,
many of them highly educated, men who would
hardly characterize such performances in private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
life as &#8220;manifest destiny&#8221; and &#8220;plain
duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few columns further on and you read how
one is wailing like a lost soul over heaps of scrap
metal and rags and waste paper, because he cannot
get permission to work them over into money
and so make us all millionaires. And who is he?
A college graduate. And who are his supporters?
Millions who have gone to school and take in the
newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>These few illustrations of the reign of illogic
are cited from the multitude available with a
double purpose. In the first place, they faintly
suggest to what an extent the citizen of a Democracy
is prey to charlatanism. In countries with
other forms of government&mdash;in monarchies and
the like&mdash;a few charlatans are licensed and erected
into respectability and power, and given the range
of the people, while all others are rigidly repressed.
In a Democracy any charlatan may license
himself. The people are prey to every and any
form of charlatanism, fraudulent or both. They
must protect themselves, or they will not be protected
at all. And right education is the only
means.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>The second point made obvious by these examples
of superstition theological, superstition
medical, superstition political, is that our education
in the past must have been defective and must still
be so. It has been seeking, it now seeks, as its
chief object, to impart knowledge, not to cultivate
the art of using knowledge, the art of thinking
correctly.</p>

<p>The ideal has been an education that is reminiscent
and is only incidentally constructive. The
democratic ideal is the education that is constructive
and only incidentally reminiscent.</p>

<p>There is only one way to this true education.
Just as a child is taught to walk, to ride, to swim,
just as it is taught to read, to write, to cipher, with
just as much care, with just as much patience, with
just as much deliberateness of purpose, must it be
taught to reason.</p>

<p>This is not in advocacy of courses in formal
logic. Those courses do not teach men to think.
They teach men what certain other men have
thought about the processes of thinking. And too
often they teach it in such a way as to discourage
the exercise of the reasoning faculty. No; the
education that will soundly educate must make of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
every kind of lesson a lesson in logic, an incessant
pointing out of reasons, reasons, reasons why certain
facts are so, certain allegations false; an incessant
demand that reasons, reasons, reasons be
given&mdash;always reasons. The interrogation point
should be the symbol over the door of every school,
high and low, as the indication of what is going
on within.</p>

<p>The average child starts in life with a question
mark at the tip of every sense. Why does this
inquisitiveness gradually disappear or become perverted
into curiosity about trivialities? Why does
going to school become a burden? Why are so
many classes at college listless and inattentive?
Why does the light, the frivolous, the thoughtless
attract and hold, while that which is in reality far
more interesting wearies and repels? Is it not because
this reasoning faculty is allowed to grow up
&#8220;any which way,&#8221; and is discouraged or suppressed
wherever memory or some other form of some
one&#8217;s else ideas can be substituted? Is it not because
to reason comes to seem a burden, a bore, a
pain? Would that be so if education were rightly
based, rightly built?</p>

<p>We Americans reason better, perhaps, than any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
other nation about a wider range of affairs; probably
not with so much depth as some other peoples,
but certainly with greater clearness. But this is
due to a compulsory training almost altogether
outside of the schoolroom. It is due to Democracy,
that compels the mind to grow as Spring&#8217;s sunshine
compels the seed. As our affairs, both public and
private, have grown more complex, the defects due
to this haphazard education of the reasoning faculty,
this treatment of it almost as if it were a weed,
become more and more apparent, more and more in
need of correction.</p>

<p>Common sense is looked upon as a gift of the
gods, a sort of intuition. Is it not in reality merely
the result of a somewhat better natural or acquired
reasoning faculty? Ought not common sense to
be the attainable possession of every American?
And where but the schoolhouse is the place to obtain
this possession, this means to self-rule, to freedom,
to the full splendor of the noblest of human
ideals, Democracy?</p>

<p>In a Democracy the school should not be the
temple of knowledge. It should be the temple of
reason. And it shall be! And that day will be a
sad one for charlatanism and for charlatans.</p>

<small>A NATION OF DREAMERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Each</span> year not far from fifty million dollars are
spent in America in exploiting cures for digestion
troubles; and no doubt we give the doctors and
the druggists a thousand millions or so each year
in seeking relief from the consequences of our ignorance
and our folly in feeding ourselves. Some
of us are too poor to get the right sort of food,
even when we know what is the right kind; others
are both ignorant and incapable of resisting the
clamors of appetite. The problems of mental
and physical food are not analogous; they are two
parts of a whole. Our ignorance of chemistry and
hygiene and our unguarded appetites lead us into
gastronomic folly; our ignorance of the simple and
easily learned laws of the mind and our vitiated
and undiscriminating mental appetites, called passions
and prejudices, lead us into educational follies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span>
as wild but no wilder than our gastronomic follies.
The results of the one show in poor health; the results
of the other show in confusion in the conduct
of our affairs, private and public.</p>

<p>Some of us have no means of getting good mental
food, and would not know what to select and
what to reject if we had. Others, and these are
the overwhelming majority, have no power to discriminate
between the true and the false, the rational
and the irrational, between that which
strengthens the powers of the mind and that which
weakens or perverts them. We take in cheap or
worthless mental food just as we put cheap or
worthless stuff into our stomachs. We take in that
which is easy and pleasant to the taste&mdash;that is,
we patronize the intellectual pastry cooks and confectioners
too liberally. Or, we go to the purveyors
of the strong waters of passion and prejudice, and
under the influence of such whiskies and brandies
imagine ourselves beings of extraordinary and fine
mentality.</p>

<p>There is as much, indeed, there is greater, cause
for alarm over the gastronomic than over the mental
follies. But neither kind is evidence that we
are on the down grade. We are more alert and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span>
wiser all the time in matters of physical health,
despite our own appetites and foolish inclinations
and lazy disinclinations, despite the pretentious ignorance
of the medical profession and the shrewd
chicanery of the quacks. In the same manner we
are more and more alive to the importance of mental
health, of the well-fed, well-exercised brain; and
this improvement goes steadily forward, despite
the harmful effects of alleged literature and drama,
despite the pretentious ignorance of our regularly
constituted teachers, despite the energetic educational
quackeries of false learning, false culture
and false taste. Intelligence will spread; Democracy
will compel.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago small indeed was the part
of the human race that could be reached by an
appeal to the reason. To-day in many parts of
the civilized world advances begin to be made not
alone by appeals to empty stomachs, by shouts
about full and empty dinner pails, but by real intellectual
force. There are even a few rare but
highly significant instances of masses of men being
induced to sacrifice a small immediate good to gain
a remoter larger good. That is, the masses begin
to show signs of that same intelligent foresight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
which created and maintained class rule in times
past, which makes some successful far beyond their
fellows. And those who are so greatly concerned
by the vast concentration of machinery and capital
in a few hands fail to give proper consideration
to the two most important points, more important
far than the evils of concentration of wealth and
power:</p>

<p>First: Concentrations of capital are at the mercy
of brains. They are impotent unless they are administered
by brains, administered by a multitude
of brains working intelligently and harmoniously
for a common end.</p>

<p>Second: Their evil consequences result from lack
of reasoning power, lack of far-sightedness, due to
imperfect education in the managers; lack of
knowledge how to protect their own interests on
the part of the masses.</p>

<p>On one hand we see an enormous increase in the
brain power of the people&mdash;a multitude able to
think, eager to think, not to be prevented from
thinking, where only two or three generations ago
the thinking was done exclusively by the few. On
the other hand we see the necessity for more thinking,
for vigorous stirring-up of the minds of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
masses, for more and more education. And, year
by year, the stirring-up process increases. The
evils of the present day are as old as the race, as
old as ignorance, as old as human frailty. The
good, the benefits, are new, entirely new.</p>

<p>The material and mental forces of modern civilization
have already wrought wonders. Think of
it! Less than a century and a half ago the world
for the first time heard a plea for the freedom, the
dignity, the individuality of man. To-day millions
of minds have that gospel as their fundamental
creed. And freedom of thought, freedom of action,
is the realized ideal of many nations, the
realizing ideal of almost all the others. Why
should we fear that the idea of manhood will lose
its charm; that the democratic ideal, which has real
beauty, should prove less attractive than the old
ideal of inequality and injustice and inhumanity,
which is now seen to be in fact hideous? Why
should we fear that as we grow in enlightenment,
grow in capacity to think and act with freedom,
we should care less and less about thinking and acting
with freedom?</p>

<p>What will come out of this vast, unbarriered
flood of sunshine of enlightenment, out of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
concentrations social called cities, these concentrations
industrial called combinations? Who can
say? Who would care to destroy life&#8217;s chief interest,
the veiled future, by foreseeing? One thing
we can be assured of&mdash;it will not be tyranny. It
could not be tyranny, because the light of intellect,
of real intelligence, is now in millions of minds,
is kindling in millions more.</p>

<p>Of the many misreadings of history perhaps the
silliest is that which attributes to former times an
idealism greater than that of our own day. And
of the many misreadings of our own times certainly
the silliest is that which attributes more idealism
to such countries as Germany, Austria, and Italy
than to these United States.</p>

<p>The Middle Ages are generally cited as the
period of intensest and loftiest idealism. But looking
past the artistic and literary few of those centuries,
looking at nations and peoples, what do we
see? Ignorance, squalor, inconceivable physical
and mental and moral wretchedness; ferocious tyrannies
worse almost than anarchy itself and constantly
producing it; stolid and heartless indifference
in almost all to the welfare of their fellow-beings;
&#8220;Every man for himself&#8221; the universal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
cry. No wonder there was a passionate yearning
for the life beyond the grave with its promise of
escape from a world made hideous by &#8220;man&#8217;s inhumanity
to man.&#8221; And in these modern countries
where so-called idealism is rampant, we find false
and oppressive social and industrial conditions in
the ascendant, we find a deplorable incapacity for
dealing with the problems of life or an ignorant
insensibility to them.</p>

<p>If idealism means inanely beating the empty air,
if it means the worship of the vague, the remote
and the purely fanciful, then this age cannot be
charged with idealism and our country must plead
guilty to the charge of gross materialism; and for
idealism we must look to seclusions and deserts,
where a few surviving dirty and distracted hermits
and yogis spend their time in fantastical imaginings.
But if idealism means rational, realizable
and realizing dreams of a to-morrow that shall be
as much better than to-day as to-day is better than
yesterday, then the world was never before so
idealistic, and America is the chief prophet and
chief apostle of idealism.</p>

<p>In this sense the Declaration of Independence is
the most idealistic literary product of the human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
mind; the so-called idealism of superstition, of
chivalry, of kingship and aristocracy, of the divinely
appointed few taking care of the many, of
&#8220;never mind this world; all will be righted in the
next,&#8221; has the cheap, dull glitter of &#8220;fool&#8217;s gold&#8221;
and paste diamonds. These fallacies were, and still
are, poisonous, because of their interference with
the growth of true idealism&mdash;the idealism of self-help
and helping others to help themselves. And
to show them up and then to show them down and
out&mdash;especially down and out of our colleges and
universities&mdash;we need another Cervantes and a revised
and enlarged Don Quixote.</p>

<p>Never before was the true ideal, humanity, clear
and universal. &#8220;Light from the East&#8221; was the
old proverb; the new proverb is &#8220;Light from
the West!&#8221; For ours is the dawn-land of the
Golden Age. We are a nation, a race of idealists,
of dreamers. Even our plutocrats, with their
Americanism submerged and all but suffocated in
their wealth, still dream fitfully of justice and
equality and universal enlightenment and the brotherhood
of man.</p>

<p>We are a nation of dreamers who make their
dreams come true!</p>

<small>NOT GENEROSITY, BUT JUSTICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is reasonable, and not unkind, to assume that
the time will come when we shall no longer have
John D. Rockefeller with us. He may not die; as
a vindication and a reward he may be honored
with the unique distinction of Enoch and Elijah.
But, whether by the vulgar route or in fiery chariot
with angel escort, go he will, and his son will reign
in his stead. The word reign is here used in the
metaphoric sense in which it is almost always used
now-a-days. For, the son of Rockefeller will not be
free literally to reign. He will be hedged about
with a thousand and one restraints. His acts will
be the result not of his own intellect and will, but
of his training, his tradition, his environment. He
will be little of the autocrat, a great deal of the
agent and servant. But, suppose that he would be
really free, really self-owned, really capable of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
mastership of his vast inheritance, instead of its
slave, doing its bidding, acting always as a son of
John D. Rockefeller and a member of the class
multi-millionaire. Suppose this possible. What
could he do with his nearly a thousand millions,
for the most part so massed that they control many
of the great vital industries of the country? Imbued
with a deep sense of trusteeship to humanity
instead of to the quaint Rockefeller god, and endowed
with the intelligence to act upon that sense,
what could he do to make the world the better for
his sojourn in it? What would be his opportunities?</p>

<p>Of course, in the reality his opportunities will
be small indeed. His limitations, through heredity,
education and environment, are too narrow.
But under our fanciful, even fantastic, &#8220;if,&#8221; there
must be surely some way for a rich man to serve
his fellow-men and demonstrate high qualities of
mind and heart other than by these commonplace,
more or less &#8220;cheap and nasty&#8221; schemes of so-called
philanthropy. To all men in the past, and to the
small man still&mdash;that is, to any man incapable of
grasping the splendid and lofty idealism of Democracy&mdash;there
could be nothing more captivating than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
playing the r&ocirc;le of my Lord Bountiful. Not
merely the paying of one&#8217;s just debts, not merely
the doing of the commands of one&#8217;s own self-respect,
but graciously condescending to part with
one&#8217;s wealth for the gratification of one&#8217;s vanity
and for the development of deference and humility
in the recipients of the bounty. Philanthropy as
it is practiced is more often than not a vice both in
its origin and in its results. So, we will not make
our imaginary young Rockefeller a philanthropist.
We will not subject him to the temptation to make
of himself a supercilious Pharisee and to make of
others paupers and parasites and courtiers.</p>

<p>He is free; he is young; he is fearless. He is
absolute master of his colossal inheritance. He
looks up at the vast structure his father built. He
reads upon it the motto his father placed there&mdash;&#8220;I
am a clamorer for dividends.&#8221; His face sobers as
he reads, and out of his mind go his half-formed
projects to endow missions and colleges and hospitals
and libraries. &#8220;Perhaps I have not so much
to give as I thought,&#8221; he says to himself. &#8220;I must
first see. What are the sources of my income?
Am I stealing from anybody? Should I be giving
away that which is not rightfully mine to give?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>And as a preliminary move he tears down the
offensive &#8220;I am a clamorer for dividends,&#8221; and
puts in its stead &#8220;I am a clamorer for justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us first be just,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Perhaps we
shall not be able to be generous. Perhaps we shall
even, hat in hand, and upon our knees, be compelled
to crave the generous forgiveness of our fellow-men.&#8221;
All this time he has been standing at
the rear or business end of the paternal structure.
He now goes round to the front or philanthropic
side of it. He closes the doors there with a sign,
&#8220;Philanthropy suspended during the taking of the
inventory.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so we find our ideal young Rockefeller, his
ears shut against the importunities of paupers and
panderers and parasites, plunging deep and resolutely
into the details of business&mdash;of the several
vast enterprises which he, by inheritance, owns or
controls. And soon all his father&#8217;s old friends,
with the approval of all the leading men in finance
and industry, are discussing whether a commission
ought not to be obtained, and cannot be obtained,
to inquire into the sanity of the young man. Not
dividends, but honesty and justice! Why, the
young fellow&#8217;s brain is turned! Denouncing business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
methods approved by the best lawyers at the
bar, sanctified by the use of the greatest captains
of industry? Insisting that commodities should be
sold at only a fair profit over and above the cost
of production? Dismissing men skilled in legal
and business chicane? Insisting that no man in his
employ shall have less than a decent living wage?
Calling for the reorganization of great properties,
not to increase but to decrease the bonds and stocks
on whose interest and dividends a hundred of our
best people are able to lead lives of elegant leisure
and look down with amused pity on those who have
to toil? There is no escape from the conclusion
that the young man is mad, mad as a hatter, mad
as a March hare.</p>

<p>If he had established soup kitchens to tempt the
hard-working to knock off and join the army of
lusty beggars, if he had given millions to enable
missionaries to live at ease while they gratified their
abnormal passion for meddling in other people&#8217;s
business, if he had subsidized faculties to teach only
&#8220;safe and sane&#8221; doctrines, if he had set aside vast
corruption funds for debauching legislatures to
suffer the people to be despoiled, if he had poured
rivers of water into the stocks and bonds of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
enterprises, had cut down wages and raised prices,
if he had built himself half a dozen palaces, and
conducted himself like a monkey that has been
given a red cap and a pink jacket&mdash;why, that would
have been sane, eminently sane. But honesty and
justice! And in his own affairs! A real, practical
application! Hear the shouts of derisive laughter.
See the winks, the tongues in derisive cheeks. &#8220;The
man&#8217;s mad! The man&#8217;s mad!&#8221; cries a generation
tainted with the coarse ideals of riches, show and
condescension.</p>

<p>But let us suppose that he is not strait-jacketed
by his friends nor daunted by the hoots of the
crowd. Let us suppose that he remains at large
and has his way. And then, let us look at his first
great &#8220;philanthropy.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first glance there seems nothing to look at,
no important change. The same old machinery
of these several huge Rockefeller industries of
manufacture, trade and transportation seems to be
moving on in much the same old way. The only
obvious change is in the fortune and the income
of the young iconoclast and his fellow-stockholders.
There is seen an enormous shrinkage&mdash;enough to
have endowed hundreds of colleges, enough to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
made millions of paupers. The difference between
the old order and the new is chiefly in moral tone.
An honest man and a criminal go through precisely
the same routine each day&mdash;dressing, eating,
talking, sleeping. The abysmal difference between
the two is invisible to human eyes.</p>

<p>Nor does the example of the new order seem to
amount to much. Such doings are too expensive.
Charity, donations, subscriptions, cost far less, do
not interfere with dividends and interest, and bring
returns in public applause. Why be honest and
just when nobody else is&mdash;when nobody appreciates
it&mdash;when the very victims of the system of dishonesty
and injustice have less respect for you?
Why refrain from &#8220;respectable&#8221; robbery when indulging
in it gives power and prestige?</p>

<p>But the young iconoclast is not discouraged. He
keeps hammering away&mdash;establishing the new
order where he has control, making a fierce and
incessant and public fight for it in those corporations
in which he is a director sitting for a minority
interest. And gradually the fury of the &#8220;respectable&#8221;
rises against him. He has outraged the great
&#8220;respectable&#8221; lawyers, who fatten on fraud and
crime; he has inflamed the stockholders and bondholders,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
great and small, who find their incomes
cut down; he has exasperated all who, but for the
pickings and stealings under the old system, would
have to work instead of idling about, pitying and
patronizing workers. He has stirred to awful fury
the whole capitalistic class, the honest ones no less
than the dishonest; for the honest capitalist, while
he looks askance at his dishonest fellow-member
of the capitalistic solidarity, yet regards him as a
wronged brother whenever any one by criticising
him seems to be criticising capitalism. And these
cyclonic ragings against the young man slowly rouse
the masses of the people, slowly waken the slumbering
moral sense of a society that has yielded to
the seductions of the practical maxim, &#8220;Put money
in thy purse.&#8221; And he is greatly cheered by the
swelling, stentorian applause of the people.</p>

<p>He has cut down his income to less than one-twentieth
what it was; but still a vast sum, far more
than he can possibly spend, pours in upon him and
demands investment. Further, many of the enterprises
in which he is a large but not a controlling
factor are of so suspicious a character, are so dependent
for success upon roguery, that he feels he
cannot continue in them. To abandon his holdings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>
would be merely to add to the incomes of the rascals;
he sensibly, but not without qualms, sells out
at as large a price as he can get. Looking for
new investments, he goes into the most crowded
and squalid section of each of the cities and large
towns in which he has interests&mdash;into those sections
where the workers associated with his various
enterprises are congregated. He buys up whole
blocks and sections of unsanitary tenements. He
tears them down and builds in place of them
houses fit for human habitation. And he adjusts
the scale of rents there, not on the familiar principle
of robbing the poor because it is so easy to do,
but on the same principles that he would apply to
business property of the kinds used by people whose
necessities are not so great that they are helpless
before the robber. He is content with a decent
profit; he takes no blood-money. He is a business-like,
human landlord, not a bloody bandit, not a
&#8220;clamorer for dividends.&#8221;</p>

<p>In each of these neighborhoods he establishes a
huge department store in which he sells everything;
and he gives value, not sham and shoddy. These
stores make a specialty of food. They sell only
wholesome food&mdash;and they can easily afford to sell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
it at the same prices which the former purveyors to
these poor got for vile, poisonous, rotten meat and
vegetables. Then he buys up the street-car lines
in his neighborhoods as far as he can, and establishes
two-cent fares. He realizes the importance
of the item of car-fare to the poor, the wickedness
of stock and bond watering to keep up the cruelest
of all taxes.</p>

<p>And now he is in hot water! He has alienated
a large and influential section of every one of the
grand divisions of respectable society. He has
against him, and purple with rage at the very mention
of his name, all the men and all the women
and all the families that directly or indirectly, consciously
or unconsciously, live by exploiting the
poor. Right and left he has cut into or cut entirely
away incomes, sources of vast profit, those infamous
yet &#8220;respectable&#8221; capitalizations of the industry
of picking the pockets in the tattered dress
of the working girl, in the ragged overalls of the
laborer! What an uproar from all that is articulate!
They cry in the newspapers that he is worse
than his father, that he is impoverishing the &#8220;best
citizens,&#8221; et cetera. They scream that he is doing
it, is using the almost infinite power of his father&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
massed millions, with an ulterior motive&mdash;solely to
increase his income.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, his income has begun to
increase. In a few years, the practice of honesty
and justice on a scale that makes it impossible for
the dishonest and the unjust to crush him, results
in his having a vaster fortune than ever. Everything
he touches turns to gold. In his main enterprise,
the policy of low prices, honest wares and
high wages causes business to flow in and to more
than make up for the old profits lost by the abolition
of the short-sighted tyrannies and monopolistic,
pound-foolish, penny-wise policies. His tenements
pay; his department stores can&#8217;t take care of the
business offered; his street-car lines are crowded.
The old business principle, time-honored, was:
&#8220;Raise prices as the demand increases.&#8221; He acts
on the new, the scientific business principle: &#8220;Lower
prices as demand increases. Don&#8217;t kill that which
you have been striving to create. Foster demand.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first he was called a &#8220;well-meaning but wildly
mistaken philanthropist.&#8221; Now he is called a
shrewder business man than his father. Like his
father, he is hated and envied by all the rich-but-not-so-rich.
And, sad yet amusing to relate, he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
profoundly suspected by those whom he is striving
to benefit. Such few friends as he has left bring
this to his attention. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; they say.
&#8220;Look at the ingrates. If you had stolen ten millions
from them and given back a hundred thousand
in charity they would have cheered you to the
echo. You pamper them, and they turn on you.
If there was to be a revolution to-morrow your
head would be the first to go off.&#8221;</p>

<p>What does the young man reply? He might
invite them to note the fact that he is making more
money than his father did and is at least escaping
the odium of being regarded as a hypocrite. But
he does not. He is a peculiar young man. He
simply smiles. &#8220;I am in business to please one customer
first of all,&#8221; says he. &#8220;That customer is myself.
What does it matter to me what other people
think of me? I don&#8217;t have to live with them. But
I do have to live with myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he orders further reductions of prices, and
further increases of wages, buys more street-car
lines, builds more tenements, opens a half dozen
other big stores. To supply these stores with meat,
eggs, butter, vegetables, et cetera, he starts in the
neighborhood of each of his cities and towns huge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
farms, to which he sends boys and girls as apprentices
to learn the farming business. And he engages
to set up in the farming business each boy or girl
who works well. Those who cannot be got in love
with farming are to have first call on the lower
positions in his various manufacturing and distributing
enterprises.</p>

<p>He has now been twenty years at this business
of applying old moral principles and policies to the
vast modern opportunities for concentration and
combination. Twenty years of hard work, and he
is a happy, hated man of fifty and odd. He is
richer than his father ever dreamed of being.
Wonder of wonders, he at last has begun to drive
the crooks and the rascals out of big business.
There is just one competition in which a crook cannot
survive&mdash;the competition with intelligent honesty.
It is a competition which had never been
tried until the coming of our fanciful, fantastic
scion of Standard Oil, black sheep in the capitalistic
fold. The crooked little farmer or merchant cannot
survive against the straight little farmer or
merchant. The crooked big &#8220;captain of industry&#8221;
found that he couldn&#8217;t survive against our Rockefeller,
inheriting his father&#8217;s business ability with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
his father&#8217;s wealth, but not inheriting his father&#8217;s
convention-calloused moral sense.</p>

<p>It is not until our young man is well on toward
sixty that there begins to be any real appreciation
of philanthropy by making money instead of by
giving it away. The laughter at honesty and justice,
in business as well as in personal relations, in practice
as well as in theory, on week-days as well as on
Sunday, toward the helpless and obscure and unknown
as well as toward the powerful and &#8220;respectable,&#8221;
gradually dies away before his ocular demonstration
of its sound practical wisdom. And his
activities have been an enormous educational factor,
giving men that practical enlightenment which
the school of life alone can give, but which, under
the old system, it so rarely did give. His high
wages have raised the general wage market. His
tenements and dwelling houses have raised the standard
of housekeeping. His department stores have
raised the standard of food and clothing. And
when the material foundations of life rose, the
moral and &aelig;sthetic structure superimposed upon
them of necessity rose also. To raise a house, raise
its foundations; don&#8217;t try to separate it from them.</p>

<p>As the laughter at iconoclastic business ceased,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
laughter at philanthropy burst out. The rich rascals,
the smug feeders of their own vanity, the coy
contributors to the conscience fund, who came in
superciliousness and condescension with their pharisaical
offerings, were greeted with hoots and jeers.
Our young man of many millions, dauntless
through all those trying years, had taught the
people to look at the true inwardness of things.
&#8220;Go back to your business,&#8221; they would shout at
each of these astonished almsgivers. &#8220;Go back,
and take with you this pittance of your filchings
from your workmen and your customers. You are
the real object of pity and charity. Look at the
tainted sources of your income! Repent, reform,
give us our rights, our just dues. Don&#8217;t pose as
a philanthropist when you are giving away our
money&mdash;and only a meagre part of the vast sums
you have taken from us. Give justice. Generosity
will take care of itself!&#8221;</p>

<p>And in those days our young iconoclast came
into his own, so everybody said. But when his
friends, wholly changed in their opinion now, approached
him with enthusiastic flattery, he smiled
his old peculiar smile. &#8220;I came into my own, years
ago,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I came into it on the day I tore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
down the motto &#8216;I am a clamorer for dividends&#8217; and
set up &#8216;I am a clamorer for justice&#8217;, in its place.&#8221;
And when he died he did not leave his vast fortune
to his children to tempt them to forget his training
and example and become soft, idle, foolish and unhappy.
He left it to his enterprises, its income to
be divided between those who made themselves
most valuable and those who, having worked well,
had earned the right to a peaceful old age.</p>

<small>THE INEVITABLE IDEAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Our</span> ancestors who migrated hither were laborers,&#8221;
wrote Jefferson. And again: &#8220;My new
trade of nail-making is to me in this country what
an additional title of nobility is or the ensigns of a
new order are in Europe.&#8221; The dignity of labor,
the prizes to the laborer&mdash;these ideals of a century
ago, ideals born no doubt of a vanity which sought
to make a virtue of necessity, are still our ideals.
But, where in Jefferson&#8217;s day his broad and sympathetic
mind was almost alone in the belief in the
loftier basis for the ideal, to-day millions of us see
that the laborer is the only good citizen, that his
estate is the only estate of dignity. No people ever
had such a conception of work as we have to-day.
It is an evolution under Democracy. No previous
nation could have understood it; our ancestors did
not have it, for they were still influenced by caste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
ideas, hard and nobly though they strove to outgrow
them. There are vestiges of the old ideas
concerning work remaining. The class that does
not work and the class that emulates it and envies
it still look down on work, still hug the vulgar,
ignorant fancy that work is a curse. But that is not
important. Once more let us remind ourselves that
caste is made not by him who looks down but by
him who looks up. The vital fact is that the laborer
is himself aware of his own sovereign dignity.
And, excepting a few black sheep, the American
flock still bears the ancestral markings; this is a
nation of laborers. And the markings of which
our ancestors tried hard, but with dubious success,
not to be ashamed, have become the markings of
honor&mdash;not to an occasional Jefferson, but to the
overwhelming mass of our eighty millions.</p>

<p>This concept of labor is the first-fruit of Democracy
and Enlightenment.</p>

<p>When sons of men of vast wealth go to work,
there is much excitement among the idlers, rich
and poor. The agitation shows how hard dies the
theory that work is wholly a curse and, to a great
extent, a degradation; that the only sensible, or
noble even, ideal of life is to idle about; that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
must be something of the freak in a human being
who labors when he might sit at his ease amusing
himself by counting the drops of sweat as they roll
from the brows of his toiling fellow-men.</p>

<p>This is indeed the old, old theory. It has the
sanction of many venerable authorities. But, like
almost everything else that has come down to us
from the ignorant far past, it will not stand examination.</p>

<p>There was a time when work undoubtedly was
both a curse and a degradation. When the many
labored under the lash that the few might reap,
when the toilers got only the toil and the idlers got
all the results, when the highest ideals of the
human race were a full stomach and fine raiment
and the gratification of other crude desires and appetites&mdash;then
work was justly regarded as degrading
drudgery. But not now, hard though laziness
and cheap vanity strive to keep alive such fictitious
distinctions as are given an air of actuality by
phrases like &#8220;master and servant,&#8221; &#8220;employer and
employ&eacute;,&#8221; &#8220;capital and labor,&#8221; &#8220;gentleman,&#8221;
&#8220;lady,&#8221; et cetera, et cetera. The truth of the
dignity of labor, the dishonesty and degradation
of every form of parasitism, however gaudily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
tricked out, appears despite the subtleties of snobism.</p>

<p>The political ideal of a barbarian is to rule
others; the political ideal of a highly civilized man
is to rule himself and let his fellow-men alone. The
industrial ideal of a barbarian is to live in empty-headed
and ambitionless idleness upon the labor of
others. The industrial ideal of a civilized man is
to work, and work incessantly in conditions that
permit him to reap the full reward of his efforts
and to make those efforts in the direction best
suited to his capacities. And he has a deepening
scorn of all the tricks by which some men live,
taking all and giving nothing. Nor is his scorn
the less when those tricks happen to be made &#8220;respectable&#8221;
by law or by custom.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that a man with the brain of
an &AElig;sop or an Epictetus should have revolted
against compulsory labor that could much better
have been performed by an ox or an ass? On the
other hand, is it not amazing that any man with a
thinking machine in his skull and vital force flowing
along his nerves can be content to lead a life that
would bore a grasshopper? The &#8220;curse and degradation&#8221;
theory of work adapts itself to climates.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
Man began in the tropics, where idleness is least
difficult; therefore for a long time absolute idleness
was the ideal of this theory. But when man
moved up into the colder parts of the earth, where
to idle was to be physically miserable, the theory
was slightly modified. The curse and the degradation
of work were thought to lie in the doing of
useful work. To tilt with iron-pointed sticks, to
stab and jab and cut, to spend days and weeks
chasing little foxes that could not even be eaten if
by chance they were caught, to hit little balls with
little sticks, to sit all night matching monotonous
picture cards&mdash;all such &#8220;amusements,&#8221; the hardest
kind of work, work at which the thinking part of
any human being might well balk, were regarded
as &#8220;worthy of a gentleman.&#8221; To plough, to sow,
to reap, to manufacture something that might be
used, to perform any kind of useful labor, mental
or manual, was &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;menial.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the last century, with our
growing wealth and the rise of a leisure class
through false education, the Old World ideas found
their way across the Atlantic. And in every community
there began to be at least a few persons who
took on the supercilious and contemptuous attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
toward work. Fortunately for the good sense and
happiness of the American people, at about that
time modern industrial conditions changed the
whole system of getting and keeping prosperous.</p>

<p>In the old days, idle and brainless barbarians
could hold on to and even add to their possessions&mdash;agricultural
land. But in the new days of intense
energy, of rapidly changing values, of trade,
commerce, and competition, of rise in the price
of labor and fall in the price of money, property is
always growing wings that must be clipped daily
and often hourly to keep it from taking flight. It
is getting harder and harder to reap where one has
not sown, to induce men to work without a proper
return, or, after wealth has been acquired, to hold
on to it without the use of brains and energy. And
so, the old theory is dying out, chiefly for the usual
reason for any human advancement&mdash;changed conditions
compelling men to change their point of
view.</p>

<p>The reason the rich men&#8217;s sons are going to work
is that they, or at least their sagacious fathers,
know that if they don&#8217;t work, the men who do work
will get their wealth away from them. And this
reason of necessity is going to bring about a revolution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
where all the shrieking of the reformers, all
the logic of the moral philosophers, all the talk
about the dignity of labor and &#8220;happiness only in
hard work&#8221; make no headway worth the measuring.
Maxims of good sense and good morals can&#8217;t
be pounded or preached into poor short-sighted,
irrational, shadow-chasing humanity. Nature and
the laws of environment do not preach. They
quietly but relentlessly compel. And sad wrecks
they make of the pretensions and pomposities of
the conceited human animal.</p>

<p>It is in vain that aristocracy-worshiping mothers
of America dream of an Old World upper class
for their sons and daughters. It is in vain that
silly sociologists prattle about the necessity and
the advantages of a &#8220;leisure class.&#8221; Modern environment
says &#8220;Work; work hard! Be a somebody
or I will make you a nobody!&#8221; And work
we must. And presently we shall hear the last of
the notions that idleness or useless employment is
&#8220;noble&#8221; and &#8220;dignified&#8221; and &#8220;aristocratic.&#8221; And
only in mad-houses will be found men and women
who continue in their grown-up periods of life the
pastimes of childhood&mdash;playing with blocks and
soldiers and toy tools. What of the old notions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
of property rights and distribution of wealth will
go by the board and what will remain, no one can
foresee. Nor does it in the least matter, since we
can be certain that no conditions will arise in which
the idler will be more comfortable or the worker
less comfortable than in the past or at present.</p>

<p>The change in the attitude toward work is coming
from both sides of the world. The rich are
more and more forced to work. The not-rich are
demanding and compelling better opportunities to
work. Look at our national life in the broad, and
you see all elements concentrating on the democratic
platform&mdash;Work! Beyond question the
&#8220;workingman&#8221; is discontented. Nor will his discontent
decrease. On the contrary, the more he
has, the more he&#8217;ll want. His appetite will grow
with what it feeds on. This Republic was started
by just such men, was started for the purpose of
creating ever more and more of them. The eagerness
for better pay, for better treatment, for better
surroundings, whether that eagerness be in the
capitalist or in the street-cleaner, is proof that the
Republic is still doing business at the old stand in
the old way. And the more or less turbulent wrangling
over the division of the rewards will never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
cease. If there were any signs of its ceasing or of
its abating, then indeed might we justly despair of
Democracy. Content means caste; discontent
means Democracy.</p>

<p>Work is democratic, not because all kinds of
men engage in it and so make it common, but because
of its effect on the individual worker. Every
impulse toward Democracy is fostered by it, just
as every impulse toward caste is encouraged by
leniency toward the idea of the value of a leisure
class.</p>

<p>The sooner ambition is roused in every man,
woman and child, the sooner they learn that by
work alone can their ambitions be gratified, the
sooner will an ideal democratic condition evolve.
America is ahead of all the great nations in the race
toward this ideal Democracy, because there is the
nearest approach in America in every walk of life
to a condition in which idlers are few and toilers
many.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter the efforts of plutocratic
philanthropists to relieve a certain part of each
community from the &#8220;stern and cruel necessity to
work&#8221; have been noted. But the pauper-making
plutocrats and lords and ladies Bountiful are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>
the only missionaries of idleness and incompetence.
Our legislatures, national, state, municipal, are
voting large sums of money for free something or
other for somebody or other, or for bolstering up
some real or reputed neglected or defective class.
And leading citizens, themselves toilers at businesses,
trade and professions, are, through mistaken
sentimentality, urging the legislatures to vote
still larger sums for indiscriminate&mdash;<i>necessarily</i> indiscriminate&mdash;alms.</p>

<p>If Democracy were dependent upon conscious
human effort, we should be moving rapidly and far
from the old ideas of independence, of self-reliance,
of individuality; we should be hastening toward a
re-establishment of the aristocratic ideal of &#8220;molly-coddling,&#8221;
of making the citizen a hot-house plant
sheltered under government glass from the rude
but invigorating forces of nature&mdash;but exposed to
withering and denuding paternalism. Everybody
who did not do for himself&mdash;whether because he
would not or because he could not, we should not
stop to ask&mdash;would be provided with education,
ideas, food, clothing, shelter, amusements, baths,
in short, everything but self-respect and the power
to produce self-respecting progeny. And these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>
things would be provided, not by private philanthropy,
not by the rich giving of their surplus, but
by taxation.</p>

<p>Taxation simply means taking from one part of
the community, chiefly from the poor and those of
moderate means, and giving to another part, after
an army of officials have had their &#8220;rake-off&#8221; in
salaries and perquisites. Taxation, therefore,
means levying upon those who have little to spare;
it means crippling those who are trying to fight the
hard battle of life.</p>

<p>There is nothing democratic, nothing economically
sound, in these alluring schemes for making
men sleek and comfortable and wise by public
bounty. They result in coddling incompetents, and
in breaking down those who are now just able to
get along and who need only the push of additional
taxation to send them fairly over the precipice from
self-reliance to dependence.</p>

<p>A wise man once said: &#8220;Most legislation consists
of A and B getting together and deciding what
C shall do for D.&#8221; We mustn&#8217;t forget C. He
pays the bills. And his name is &#8220;the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The work that saves is the work of a man, by
himself, for himself, work chosen by him, mastered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span>
by him, work by which he is sometimes mastered.
He must stand or fall on the results of his
efforts. This is no programme for the timid or the
halting, but it is the programme for all grades of
intelligence and opportunity, each doing for himself
just as well as he possibly can, under his circumstances.</p>

<p>Work&mdash;not as a means to leisure, but as in itself
the aim and end. No thought of &#8220;retiring.&#8221; No
thought of social distractions that breed only boredom,
or of useless activities that dissipate manhood
and womanhood. The main thought&mdash;work.
Work is <i>the</i> ideal of the Republic. The central
point in the Old World theory which our plutocracy
would make our theory of life is that a man or
woman ought to aspire not to be a worker, but a
person of leisure, to become not a doer of useful
things, but a doer of useless things. The central
point of the democratic theory of life is just the
reverse. It is the worker exalted, and his work
also. Europe clings to precedent; America insists
upon judgment. Europe tends to act as &#8220;father
and grandfather did&#8221;; America has acted and
should tend to act as the new situation, ever
changing, may require at any given moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>Europe, bound by precedents, by false ideals, by
traditions of class distinctions and the nobility of
idleness, simply cannot compete with us. For the
cause of Democracy, for the uplifting of the common
man, for the increase in the application of
human energy to human needs, America&#8217;s competition
with Europe is more helpful than centuries of
theorizing and preaching and political maneuvering.
The Great Republic is presenting to Europe
the stern alternative: Democracy or Decay.</p>

<small>OUR ALLIES FROM ABROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> European &#8220;hordes&#8221; continue to pour in
upon us, and the agitation over, and against, the
&#8220;foreign devil&#8221; increases. We shall soon be &#8220;welcoming
to our shores&#8221; upwards of a million strangers
a year, all of them with no &#8220;capital&#8221;&mdash;except
their muscles and the potentialities of their minds
and hearts. If Washington and Jefferson could
have looked forward to this time, they would have
lifted jubilant prayers of thankfulness that their
hopes that this land would become &#8220;the refuge of
the poor and oppressed of all nations&#8221; were being
superbly realized. But many of our statesmen view
the tidal-wave incursions with anything but joy;
and their woful cries find echo everywhere among
those who do not take the trouble to put facts into
proper perspective. Russian and Finn, Polack,
Hun and Lithuanian, Sicilian and Greek and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
Syrian and Bohemian, on they come, streaming
from the noisome steerages of great ocean liners,
pouring through the gates of the immigration offices.
They are obviously poor, obviously the descendants
of generations of toilers. And with them
are their wives and their children. Myriads of
anxious, troubled faces, in which hope and fear
alternately triumph in the struggle for expression.
Indeed, a disquieting spectacle to those who cannot
or will not look beneath surfaces at universal
human nature with its powerful instincts for and
resolves toward progress. But let us watch this
incoming flood with American eyes. Let us see
what the facts plead&mdash;the facts, as distinguished
from prejudices.</p>

<p>What is our so-called foreign-population problem?</p>

<p>According to the latest census there were in the
United States, of our 76,300,000 population, no
less than 26,200,000 persons of foreign birth or
parentage. Of these, ten and a half millions were
born abroad, while 11,000,000 more were born in
this country of parents who were foreign-born.
Since 1880 and up to 1901 no less than 18,000,000
foreigners have come to us. That is to say, counting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
in arrivals and births since the taking of our
latest census, and making due mortality allowance,
we have to-day a population more than one-fourth
of which was born abroad or is of foreign
parentage.</p>

<p>The anti-immigration crusade based upon these
figures insists that the foreigners come too fast for
Americanism to digest and assimilate them, that
they will undermine and destroy free institutions.
Also, there is the cry that these recent comers are
of peoples less desirable than those that used to
send their millions to us. The newcomers are impossible
in point of numbers, undesirable in point
of quality.</p>

<p>As to numbers&mdash;Our first, and last previous,
great flood of immigration was between 1840 and
1861. In those twenty years about 13,000,000
immigrants came. Our population in 1840 was
17,000,000. Thus, the immigration was about 80
per cent. Between 1880 and 1901, the immigration
was about 18,000,000. Our population in
1880 was 50,000,000. Thus, the immigration was
not much above 35 per cent. Clearly, the present
&#8220;horde&#8221; is numerically not imposing or alarming in
comparison with the foreign invasion of half a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
century ago. Our country is still sparsely inhabited;
one-third of its area is still absolutely undeveloped.
If half a century ago, with the then comparatively
limited and crude means of transforming
the foreigner into the American, thirteen million
foreigners did not &#8220;swamp&#8221; seventeen million
Americans, how can the present lesser immigration
seriously or permanently hinder the alert, democratically
militant America of to-day?</p>

<p>Then, there is the matter of distribution. Let
us take New York City by way of illustration.
There the &#8220;congestion&#8221; of immigration is greater
than anywhere else; and the advocates of exclusion
always point to it as the crowning &#8220;awful example.&#8221;
In the &#8217;40s and &#8217;50s that city grew almost
altogether by immigration from abroad. Between
1840 and 1861 New York City increased from
312,000 to 814,000&mdash;502,000. The rate of
growth, then, was just over 160 per cent. Between
1880 and 1901 the same territory increased in population
from 1,200,000 to 2,050,000&mdash;850,000,
and a large part of that increase was from the
smaller cities, the towns and the rural districts of
the United States. The ratio of increase was about
70 per cent., less than half what it was during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
preceding great immigration. Further, the charitable
and corrective forces, official and unofficial,
at work in New York are not much occupied with
the immigrants who have come in the last twenty
years. The crime, the abject poverty, the destitution
are among the earlier immigrants and their
descendants. The later immigration is not from
peoples given to excess in drink&mdash;and drunkenness
is the chief cause of the miseries of crime and
pauperism.</p>

<p>Looking at the immigration problem thus numerically,
we see that the pessimists and the panic-stricken
are afflicted with the narrowness of geographic
and historical vision which is responsible
for so many jeremiads. The shriek that the nation,
and especially its cities, are being &#8220;swamped&#8221; has
no basis in mathematics.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the quality! The quality!&#8221; they cry. Well,
what of the quality? Turn to the files of the publications
in the middle of the last century; read
what the &#8220;good Americans&#8221; then said and wrote
and thought of the vast in-marching armies of
&#8220;foreign devils,&#8221; whose grandchildren are a valuable
part of our citizenship to-day. They were
&#8220;the scum of Ireland and Germany.&#8221; They were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
&#8220;incapable of receiving American ideas.&#8221; They
were &#8220;welcomed by the rich employers because
their coming meant cheap labor.&#8221; And loudest in
lamentation and fiercest in demand for bars and
barriers were the people who had themselves just
arrived!</p>

<p>But, that was a false alarm, say the anti-immigrationists;
this is the real thing. Again a lamentable
lack of historical perspective, a pitiful narrowness
of human sympathy. The truth is that man,
from whatever clime or nation, is first of all man,
the materials of progress and civilization. If the
present millions of newcomers are ignorant, so
much the less will they have to unlearn. If they
have been savagely oppressed, so much the more
brightly will burn hatred of inequality and injustice,
love of equality and justice. If they are poor&mdash;and
poor they are&mdash;then, Heaven be praised!
They will work hard; and hard work and a passionate
eagerness to get on in the world, and the
prospect of being able to rise by work instead of,
as at home, toiling that others might reap all, will
make them hasten to become the best possible
Americans.</p>

<p>From poverty and experience of oppression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
comes the most militant Democracy. Let us not be
afraid of this our brother-man. Let us not judge
him by the superficial and unimportant differences
between him and us. Let us welcome him. He
needs us, but not more than we need him, and his
familiarity with hard work, and his nature unspoiled
by over-prosperity. Above all, we need his
children. They will be American through and
through. They will help us to outvote and to over-balance
and to counteract the supercilious breed of
falsely educated who have fallen away from the
high and noble ideal of the equality and the
brotherhood of man. These newcomers are the
descendants of the peoples that built the splendid
civilization of the past&mdash;the civilization around the
Mediterranean and in Eastern Europe. For centuries
the immense energy and imagination of those
peoples have been forcibly suppressed and repressed.
But they are there, and in free America
they will burst forth again. Indeed, they are already
bursting forth.</p>

<p>We hear so much about the glories of the Civil
War that we are apt to overlook its fearful cost.
One item is important here:</p>

<p>In the Southern States, practically all the white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
males able to bear arms went to the war. In the
Northern States the two and three-quarter millions
who served were, on the average, under rather than
over twenty years of age.</p>

<p>That is to say, to the war the South gave all its
manhood; the North gave the fathers of its present
native-born generation. So abounding is our vitality
as a people that we cannot clearly see the full
results of this fearful sacrifice. But let us remember
that war kills only a few; it returns to peaceful
pursuits the vast majority poisoned and weakened
by all kinds of diseases.</p>

<p>What is the connection between these facts and
immigration? Look at the South, which sent all
its manhood to camp and march and battle; at the
South, into which almost no immigration has gone
to make good the enormous losses. The trouble
with the South to-day is not the destruction or
abolition of property, not the failure of natural
resources, but the depletion, the decay, the destruction
of so large a part of the splendid stock that
made the South great in ante-bellum days. Despite
its abounding natural resources, despite the valiant
efforts it has made and is making, the South advances
slowly and with difficulty. And while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span>
North had to make no such complete sacrifice to
war, still even there, in the few places to which
foreign immigration has not penetrated, the effects
of the impairment of the sources of the best manhood
are plainly visible. Not infrequently you
find a Northern town with all the natural opportunities
to progress, yet with retrogression and
decay eating it away. What&#8217;s the matter? The
war; the Civil War. The best young men, the
most vigorous, the most enterprising, the most ambitious,
went to the war. Many of them came
back; but they had left at the war their best&mdash;their
health, their energy. And the present generation
shows it, suffers for it.</p>

<p>It is indeed inspiring to see young men eager to
die gloriously for their country. We also need
young men eager to <i>live</i> gloriously for their country.
And war, the arch-enemy of progress, the
great trickster of man through his finest instincts,
how many of those who would have lived most gloriously
for their country has it cost us!</p>

<p>Do we not owe to the &#8220;hordes&#8221; from Europe, to
immigration, the good fortune that our nation has
pushed on apparently almost unaffected in its manhood
by the great calamity of &#8217;61-&#8217;64? Is it unwarranted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
to suggest that but for these inpourings
of vigor and vitality, the losses in that frightful
catastrophe might have all but cost us our national
greatness, would certainly have set us back several
generations?</p>

<p>As to the political effect of immigration: Among
our cities the two most conspicuous examples of
misgovernment are New York and Philadelphia.
In each the dominant political machine is scandalously
corrupt. But it is far more audacious, far
more cynically and openly contemptuous of public
opinion in Philadelphia than in New York. Philadelphia
is an &#8220;American&#8221; city; New York is a
&#8220;foreign&#8221; city. In Philadelphia the corruption
seems almost hopeless; in New York the element
to which every movement for betterment looks&mdash;not
in vain&mdash;is the &#8220;foreign&#8221; element. The weakness
of Tammany&#8217;s control over the masses of
&#8220;German-Americans&#8221; and &#8220;Italian-Americans&#8221;
and &#8220;Jewish Russian-Americans&#8221; is the chief
reason why it does not feel easy and secure in the
enjoyment of plunder. Cities where the &#8220;foreign
vote&#8221; is preponderant may be corrupt; but so also
are cities where the native American rules undisputed.
Manifestly, the causes of political corruption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>
are deeper than immigration, are not aggravated
by it. And since our most hopeful States
politically are for the most part those into which
immigration from abroad has been pouring in a
vast and steady stream for fifteen years, is there not
sufficient ground for the confident assertion that
the newcomer with his untainted passion for
Democracy and his new-born hope of rising in the
world is one of our tremendous political assets?</p>

<p>As to the industrial effect. The overwhelming
mass are farmers or unskilled laborers. But the
wages of unskilled labor cannot be much depressed.
In all ages and in all countries the unskilled laborer
has got just about enough to keep him alive&mdash;never
much more, often a little less. In America,
as a whole, the condition of unskilled labor to-day
is better than it ever has been. The fact that
we have so much rough work to do in developing
our vast raw resources makes America the best
market for unskilled labor the world has ever seen;
and it will be many generations before that rough
work is completed, so inadequate is our supply of
unskilled labor in proportion to the demand. In
the trades the competition of the immigrant has
not lowered wages. There again we have more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
work to do than there are workers. <i>The forces
that have operated unfavorably upon wages are
notoriously not forces of competition among wage-earners,
but forces tending to abolish competition
among employers for the services of the skilled
laborer.</i> And in combating these forces, is the
immigrant a help or a hindrance? Does his vote
go for tyranny or for freedom?</p>

<p>The disposition of prosperity to look down on
poverty, to drift out of <i>brotherly</i> sympathy with it,
to misunderstand it, is as old as property rights.
The disposition of the so-called educated to look
down on the less educated, to mistake knowledge
for intellect, absurdly to exaggerate the practical
and even the &aelig;sthetic value of &#8220;polite learning,&#8221;
to under-estimate the all-round importance of that
real education which is got only in the school of
rude experience&mdash;this supercilious disposition is as
old as human vanity. It insinuates itself into the
sanest characters; it makes fools and incompetents
and snobs of many promising young men. And
these two errors&mdash;the one, through prosperity; the
other, through false education&mdash;are responsible for
the failure of such a large section of our &#8220;elegantly
articulate&#8221; to appreciate that we are to-day getting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
from abroad the best in brain and in vitality that
we have ever got.</p>

<p>What differentiates the immigrant from those
he left behind him? Why, he had the enterprise,
the courage to protest against the slavery in which
militarism and despotism were enwrapping all. He
left; he made the long and arduous journey into
this remote and unknown land. He did not give
up when conditions became too hard, did not sink
into serfdom; he boldly made a hazard of new
fortunes.</p>

<p>Away back in the centuries, Asia&#8217;s most vigorous
fled from her into Europe&mdash;and Asia sank into the
slough of despotism and Europe became great and
strong, advancing in all the arts. Now-a-days&mdash;to-day
no less than when Salem and Jamestown and
New Amsterdam and New Orleans were founding&mdash;Europe
is causing her best to fly to us. Her
best, indeed! We must be American enough, democratic
enough, to disregard the snob standards of
our weak wanderers off after European caste and
culture; we must look at men in the true American
fashion&mdash;must look at men as <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>From the common people our Democracy&mdash;like
all Democracy&mdash;sprang; by the common people is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
it nourished; by the common people will it prevail.
And these newcomers are of the common people,
the custodians of the highest ideals that irradiate
the human imagination. Unimportant indeed is the
traffic of individuals and ideas that goes first-class
between America and Europe, in the comparison
with the traffic that goes steerage.</p>

<small>THE REAL AMERICAN WOMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> American woman is regarded both here
and abroad as the strongest and subtlest enemy of
the American Democracy. She is pictured in the
imaginations of students of our life as ignorant of
politics, interested only in her own sovereignty over
the American man, or, rather, over his pocketbook,
a snob and a climber and a worshiper of European
aristocratic institutions; a poor housekeeper and a
reluctant mother, and a very vampire for luxury
and show, she hides her superficiality and cold-heartedness
under a mask that is fair and fascinating.
She is a born caste-worshiper, an instinctive
hater of Democracy.</p>

<p>What truth, if any, is there in these hardy
criticisms?</p>

<p>We have noted how, under the leadership and
inspiration of the capital of plutocracy, New York,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
every city in the country is, with true American
rapidity, developing its individual fashionable society.
It is directed by the wives and daughters of
rich men; it is, as we have seen, devoted chiefly to
spending time and money in unproductive and more
or less frivolous forms of self-amusement. The
character of this &#8220;set&#8221; varies slightly for each
locality&mdash;but only slightly. In the West the wealth-worship
is franker; in the East more hypocritical,
more beslimed and bemessed with cant about birth
and culture. But whether Mammon is naked and
unashamed or is draped and decorated, he is still
Mammon. The monotonous sameness of the
people comprising each division of the set, the
sameness of their opportunities and aims, the
world-neighborliness which railways and telegraph
and printing press have brought about, prevent any
notable differences. To dress, to talk, to eat, to
drive, to entertain, to bring up one&#8217;s children, all
in accord with the standards of &#8220;good form&#8221; established
by the aristocratic societies of Europe; to
spend each day in pleasures that permit one to
shift most of the labor and all the thinking and
providing to hirelings of divers degrees, from lawyers
and industrial managers to secretaries, housekeepers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[Pg 255]</span>
butlers, valets and maids; to live worthlessly
without useful work&mdash;these are the aims,
East, West, and South. And in rapidly increasing
measure the aims are accomplished.</p>

<p>Universal freedom, universal opportunity, all
but universal toil, have indeed very suddenly
brought vast riches to America, vast wealth to
a few. This sudden wealth, coming to a people
whose characteristics are energy, restlessness and
lightning-like adaptability, has all in a day relieved
a relatively small but, in another aspect, very numerous
and most influential part of each large community
from the necessity to labor. Many, a great
many, of these continue to strive to cherish the
ideals of a life of useful labor, continue to strive
to set a worthy example to their children and to
their fellow-citizens&mdash;that is, to remain sane and
American. But a great many others have eagerly
adopted those alien ideals of the aristocracy of idleness
and the vulgarity of toil which appeal so
strongly to the vanity and other ancient weaknesses
of the human animal the world over.</p>

<p>For this state of affairs women, imperfectly educated,
wrongly, sillily educated, in fact, practically
uneducated, are in the main responsible. Our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[Pg 256]</span>
women, like our men, inherit the American energy
and restlessness. Where circumstances compel,
they work in the home, the shop, the factory, the
office, in the fine American way. But where circumstances
do not compel they seek other outlets
for their restless energy. And thus we find rich
wives and daughters organizing elaborate establishments
and fashionable sets and international
circuits, and devoting themselves to erecting the
life of frivolity and show into a career that will at
once fill their idle hours, gratify their vanity, and
give them the sense of doing something ambitious,
of &#8220;getting on in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among a people who have always yielded a commanding
position to women, the power of this new
American woman&mdash;attractive in dress and in surroundings,
so often fascinating in personality,
usually clever and so plausible that she deceives no
one more completely than herself&mdash;could not but
be enormous. Is it strange that she weakens the
hold of the old ideals upon her husband and upon
the men who are drawn to her attractive house?
Is it strange that they persuade their consciences
to let them neglect to-day&#8217;s duties while they help
her amuse them and herself? Is it strange that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span>
has sons and daughters devoted to her ideals? Is
it strange that she gathers about her more and
more backsliders from the democratic conception
of life?</p>

<p>Organized as we are, there is absolutely no useful
place for a leisure class. We do not purpose
to be ruled, but, on the contrary, insist that our
public administrators shall be chosen from the main
body of toilers and shall execute, not direct, the
popular will. Since leadership in public and private
activity thus falls to the toiler in a Democracy,
these fashionable &#8220;sets&#8221; provided by the women of
the rich class are wholly alien and hostile to us as
a democratic people. And they inevitably become
a menace as their influence extends over the men
and women of superior education or natural endowments
who should be the leading exemplars of the
American ideal. And this menace threatens to
erect itself into what pessimists would call a
&#8220;peril,&#8221; as the &#8220;community of interest&#8221; creates
monopolies so intertwined with our individual
structure that to assail them is to jeopardize it, and
perpetuates wealth in certain families and groups.</p>

<p>Such is the anti-democratic woman. But over
against her set the American woman. The plutocratic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>
American man, being gaudy and conspicuous,
distracts attention from the democratic American
man, who outnumbers and outvotes and out-influences
him into insignificance, except as an awful
warning against flying in the face of the world&#8217;s
democratic destiny. The plutocratic American
woman is even more conspicuous than the plutocratic
American man. But contrast her with the
rest of the women, especially with the women who
go forth from the homes to work. Great as is the
influence against Democracy exerted by the women
of the leisure class, it is weak in comparison with
that exerted for Democracy by the professional and
business women of the United States.</p>

<p>Ten years ago about one-fifth of all the wage
and salary earners in the United States were women
and girls. When these figures were published there
was a great outcry of wonder and alarm&mdash;wonder
at the changed conditions, alarm lest those changed
conditions might be permanent and the old-fashioned
woman of the fireside and the stoveside and
the cradleside might be passing away. To-day
about one-third of all the women in the United
States not on farms earn their own living outside
their own homes, and these women constitute more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
than one-fourth of all the persons in the United
States engaged in gainful occupations other than
agriculture.</p>

<p>It is evident that the changed conditions are not
passing, but permanent; that the &#8220;new woman&#8221; is
the woman of the future. Yet we still hear the
old order talked of as if it were not a departing
order, and the new order criticised as if it were abnormal,
a fad of a few &#8220;freak&#8221; women.</p>

<p>Obviously, this change is most intimately associated
with Democracy. Democracy, work, women;
women, work, Democracy. Did any of those ancient
republics we hear so much about, those whose
decline and fall Europe and our own pessimists
say we must inevitably imitate, ever number among
its inhabitants a company of women wage and
salary earners such as has been so swiftly evolved
in democratic, work-compelling, work-exalting
America?</p>

<p>In face of this army of women who work outside
the home, the theory still is that man bears the
brunt of the battle for food, clothing and shelter,
while woman is sheltered and comparatively at her
ease. This theory never was sound. It never
would have been accepted had writers and thinkers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span>
kept clearly before their minds the fact that the
human race does not consist of a luxuriously comfortable
class, but of vast masses of laborious millions.
From time immemorial, among the masses
of the people everywhere, the men and the women
have worked equally for the support of the family.
But latterly, under the pressure of modern conditions,
which are forcing all into the general service
of society, the women have been drawn from the
obscure toil of occupations within and around the
household; and also into the ranks of women toilers
have gone hundreds of thousands of women
from the classes which, until recently, did try to
keep their women at home. Is it illogical to say
that we may presently see practically all the capable
members of our society, regardless of sex, self-supporting?
And in such circumstances, would not the
family relations, the relations of mother to father,
and both to children, necessarily undergo a radical
transformation?</p>

<p>To-day the women vote in four States and hold
public office in all the States and under the National
Government. There are women policemen and firemen,
women locomotive engineers, women masons
and plasterers and gunsmiths, women street-car<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span>
drivers and conductors, women blacksmiths and
coopers and steel and iron workers, and even
women sailors&mdash;to take only a few occupations
which, on the face, would seem to exclude women.
In fact, there is not in this country a single department
of skilled or unskilled labor, except only
soldier and man-o&#8217;-war&#8217;s man, which has not its
women workers in swiftly increasing numbers. In
the professions there are thousands of women doctors,
lawyers, authors, professors, musicians,
artists, decorators, journalists, public speakers, and
more than a hundred thousand women teachers.
In the trades there are thousands of women hotel
and restaurant keepers, insurance and real estate
agents, bookkeepers, clerks, merchants, officers in
corporations, saleswomen, stenographers, telegraph
and telephone operators. In manufactories the
women operatives almost equal the men in numbers.
There are thousands of women who hold responsible
positions in the management of manufacturing
corporations. All these occupations, with the exception
of such as nursing and teaching school and
music, were once exclusively in the hands of men.</p>

<p>The cause of the change is the same as that
which has revolutionized every part of modern society&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
amazing discoveries of science, creating
an enormous number of new occupations and revolutionizing
the method of all the old occupations,
from housekeeping to national administration.</p>

<p>War was the department of human endeavor
which not only excluded women from itself, but
also kept her fast anchored at home. Until the
second quarter of the last century war was the chief
thought, the chief pursuit of the human animal.
He was either just going to war or just coming
home from war, or engaged in war or preparing for
imminent war. Obviously, so long as war occupied
this position in human affairs woman was inevitably
in the background, in the secondary places, a household
drudge or plaything. But war is no longer
the principal business of the race, with peace tolerated
as a breathing spell now and then. Peace
and its arts have become the serious business of
civilization, the settled order, with war as a dreadful
nightmare. The wars, if not fewer, are briefer
and are carefully concentrated and confined. Civilization
has been forced upon a peace basis not by
enlightenment, but by commerce growing out of
discovery and invention. It clamors for skilled
hands, not for brutal hands. Hence the vast opening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>
for women and the vast inrush of women. It
is a democratic tide. Out of discovery and invention
comes commerce; out of commerce and its intercourse,
which is death to all forms of provincialism,
both mental and physical, comes enlightenment;
in the train of enlightenment, as day in the
train of the sun, comes Democracy.</p>

<p>This country was remote from other great nations
and, therefore, from the ever present threat
of the actuality of war. It was&mdash;perhaps through
its freedom from war and war alarms&mdash;eagerest
in seizing upon and using the mighty industrial
machinery which science gave to the race. Thus
it has come to pass with us that the abolition of
the non-worker, the progress toward the industrial
equality of the two sexes, has been most rapid.</p>

<p>Where European societies had a very complex
organization, our society had from the beginning
simplicity as its chief characteristic. We were
really all toilers&mdash;until recently almost all toilers
at occupations close to manual labor. The women
and the men were throughout on that equal basis
which in Europe was, and to a great extent is yet,
found only among the peasant and shopkeeping
classes. And as the new era&mdash;the era of steam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span>
and electricity&mdash;developed with us, our women and
our men naturally remained side by side.</p>

<p>Our government was founded in war. Its founders
assumed, from the history of all other nations,
that offense and defense were to be its main functions.
And the barbaric theory is still ignorantly
or carelessly assented to. This explains the lagging
of the political rights of women behind their industrial
and civil rights&mdash;or, rather, industrial and
civil necessities; for no right has ever been, or probably
ever will be, recognized until recognition becomes
a necessity. The development with us of
a class of women who are housekeepers only and
are most of the time idle or half idle, is foreign
to the spirit of our democratic era. That development
cannot, therefore, long survive, any more than
an equatorial plant can long survive in our zone.
The new departures are in harmony with Democracy;
they mean increased efficiency and usefulness
of the human race; they must persist and expand
and prevail.</p>

<p>To three causes we owe the American woman
of the class that only pretends to contribute, or at
best half-heartedly contributes, toward the support
of our social system:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>First, to the survival of the Old World, old era
ideas of &#8220;woman&#8217;s sphere,&#8221; of the coarsening effect
of labor upon her &#8220;finer nature,&#8221; of the &#8220;aristocratic
flavor&#8221; and &#8220;high breeding&#8221; of uselessness
and idleness.</p>

<p>Second, to the simpler tastes of our ancestors,
and the comparative ease with which at an early
period in our national life the labor of the men
in the family could provide money enough to satisfy
those tastes.</p>

<p>Third, to the very tardy development of the domestic
laborers and providers that now relieve
woman of the confining cares of household and
nursery.</p>

<p>As a result of these three causes a class of idle
women sprang up&mdash;not only among the rich and
well-to-do, but even among artisans, small farmers
and shopkeepers. And this class came to be
regarded as typical and exemplary. In reality it is
neither. It has no place in our tradition of mothers
and grandmothers who spun and made preserves,
did their own housework, and were busy every
waking moment about matters which are now attended
to in shops and factories. It has no place in
common sense&mdash;the women who insist most strenuously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
that child-bearing and home-making are
woman&#8217;s whole duty are the women who, as a class,
leave the care of the home to servants and bear few
children and consign them to nurses at the earliest
possible moment. And manifestly it has no place
in our future; it must inevitably go the way of all
else that is undemocratic and parasitic. Our society
is founded upon the two ideas&mdash;work and equal opportunity
to all to work. It abhors the idler as
nature abhors a vacuum. And as the old-time occupations
of woman are carried on in a different way,
she must find other occupations. Must, because
man will be unable both to support himself in the
comfort he ever more exactingly demands and also
to support her in idleness as well as she insists upon
being supported. Must, because her own increasing
aversion to restraint will not let her rest content
with the slavish and shameful position of a cajoler
and dependent.</p>

<p>The sex instinct is powerful enough to triumph
over even the instinct of self-preservation for a
time; but it cannot withstand the steady, day-by-day,
month-by-month, year-by-year pressure of that
instinct of self-preservation incessantly stimulated
by the operations of economic forces. The old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
order, bulwarked by tradition and by the sex-passion
and by woman&#8217;s ingenuity and man&#8217;s weakness
where women are concerned, will survive long,
will disintegrate gradually. But how can it be
saved?</p>

<p>Thus we have a social organization which is in
process of revolutionary change. The women are
rapidly pushing out or are rapidly being pushed
out into occupations which have been transferred
from the domestic to the general sphere; they are
entering upon occupations new and old which it was
thought a few years ago would be for the men
only. The men on their part not only are working
as formerly, but also are entering occupations once
followed exclusively by women. Some of the new
employments of women have already been enumerated.
The new employments of men in this
country include laundry work, cooking, general
housework, nursing, keeping boarding-houses,
teaching primary and kindergarten pupils, dressmaking,
millinery. The list is far shorter and,
from the old viewpoint where the equal dignity of
all honorable labor was denied, seems far less dignified
than the women&#8217;s list. The reason for this
is of course that the men had small room to expand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
their already multiform activities, while the women
had all the room in the world.</p>

<p>The underlying principle of this redistribution
of activities is the common-sense principle that
every unit in a society should do the work at hand
for which it is best fitted. This principle explains
every case. Where we find a man dusting, scrubbing
and doing laundry work it is because he could
find nothing more remunerative to do and could
outbid the women applying for that particular task.
Wherever we find a woman plastering, or keeping
books, or driving a street-car, or managing a store
or corporation, it is for the same reason. And this
modern principle wholly ignores sex and looks only
at the work to be done and at the comparative fitness
of the male and female applicants for it. We
are being taught by destiny that parasitism and dependence
are no more essentials of the feminine
than the brands and manacles which at one time
most men wore were essentials of the masculine.</p>

<p>It is not prophecy to say that, as more and more
millions of women enter the industrial fields, these
readjustments and redivisions, this absorption of
some occupations by women and of other occupations
by men, will go on apace. We may not like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
it; but we can no more stop it than we can stop the
physical and mental development of woman, or the
use of steam and electricity.</p>

<p>The missionary work for Democracy done by the
women already understanding the values of work
will undoubtedly eventually reach the &#8220;exclusive,&#8221;
most distinctly leisure class. Its influence is seen on
every hand, among the girls and young women
of the very well-to-do, in families where the daughters
are still persuaded to remain idly at home
against their own inclinations. Probably every
woman earning her own living, who has associates
among women more or less comfortably supported
in idleness, and in restraint, by men, is envied by
not a few of them, by all not hopelessly corrupted
by laziness and caste. And eventually they will
be following her example. As the number of educated,
valuable women forced to work for a living
increases, the number of the same kind of women
voluntarily going to work will increase.</p>

<p>And finally the richer women will be reached
and impelled. Their yearning to do something will
take tangible form. We may live to see the discontented,
folly-chasing daughters of the rich stepping
not down to, but up to a place beside the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span>
woman wage-earner, because they are sick and tired
of having no sensible employment, tired of the pitiful
wait for some man with the right qualifications
of personal and pecuniary attractiveness; because
they have sufficiently developed in intelligence to
have not a theoretic but a practical envy of the joys
of the woman who is absolute mistress of herself
and is waiting for the right man only as a man
now waits for the right woman.</p>

<p>There is no such simplifier of life as work. Its
effect upon the dress, the home surroundings, the
very expression and manners of women once accustomed
to leisure, is enormous. It tends to make
them far more attractive to their own sex and also
to such men as are not afraid an intelligent, competent
woman would at close range discover the shallowness
of their posings and pretenses. Finally, it
makes them democratic&mdash;all of them that have the
wisdom to look on their work not as a sentence to
drudgery from which they hope they can presently
cajole some man into releasing them, but as a high
dispensation of destiny in their favor. The &#8220;emancipation
of woman&#8221; is no mere sonorous phrase.
The new woman can, indeed must, retain all the
virtues of the &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; woman. Feminine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
is as eternal and immutable as masculine; and the
other virtues of the old were the virtues inseparable
from a life of busy usefulness. The new woman
can and must, and therefore will, free herself from
the vices of the old-fashioned woman&mdash;the vices of
narrowness and irrationality, of artifice that harks
back to the days when woman was the servant of
man&#8217;s appetites and had to pander to them.</p>

<p>The decisive advantage the men have had in the
fifty years since Democracy set its powerful forces
to work upon woman has been not their superior
strength or skill or faithfulness or industry, but
that woman has worked merely as a temporary expedient.
She has tenaciously assumed that she
would presently &#8220;quit work&#8221; and be supported by
some man. This dream has been largely fanciful,
though none the less potent for that. The woman,
married, has usually found that she has not stopped
working, but has undertaken a far more laborious
and ever grudgingly paid occupation. The delusion
has made her wages smaller. Who will not
pay more to a worker who expects to go on working
than to a worker who expects presently to stop
work, and is meanwhile giving at least half her
energy to another occupation, that of catching a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span>
husband? The delusion has also destroyed or impaired
her ambition. Why struggle to rise in an
occupation which one hopes and intends presently
to abandon for another that is wholly different?</p>

<p>But latterly a host of women have been coming
into conspicuous positions because ambition drove
them there. They have begun to work for work&#8217;s
sake. They have seen the fraud in the silly and
shallow twaddle about &#8220;woman and the home&#8221;&mdash;as
if for centuries the mothers of the men most
useful to society had not been for the most part
working women who could not, if they would, have
pleaded child-bearing and nursery and housework
in excuse for doing nothing to add to the family
income. The &#8220;new woman&#8221; is not a slovenly drudge
waiting irritably for the advent of a husband that
she may become a tenement &#8220;sill-warmer&#8221; or a
palace parasite. She works until she is married;
she continues to work after she is married. And
there is no shadow of a taint of pecuniary interest
in the love and affection she gives.</p>

<p>Disregard the negligible few women of the plutocracy
and its environs, as we have disregarded
the unimportant few men of the same class, and
looking at all over eight millions, you find that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>
American woman, like the American man, is developing
in harmony with the ideal of Democracy.
Democracy is no discriminator either among persons
or between sexes. It respects the mothers of
future generations as profoundly as it respects the
fathers. And it has the same gifts for all&mdash;freedom,
intelligence, the joy of work.</p>

<small>AS TO SUCCESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has often been said, and written, that we are
about the most unhappy people on the face of the
earth, that our unhappiness increases with our
Democracy. That our unhappiness is caused by our
Democracy. Democracy and discontent, despotism
and discontent, constitutional monarchy and content&mdash;so
runs the argument.</p>

<p>If this were true, we as Americans would say,
&#8220;Happiness bought at the price of self-respect is
far too dear. Heaven itself would be too dear at
that price. And, however it may be with some
Europeans, to an American the admission that he
was not the equal of any man would be a degradation
like that of the slave.&#8221; But it is not true that
we are an unhappy people. Not to be sunk in a
bucolic stupor like the peasants of Europe does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
mean unhappiness. To know when one is uncomfortable,
to think how to become less uncomfortable,
to be alive, alert, aspiring, to love work as
other people love play, to love progress as other
people love stagnation&mdash;that does not mean unhappiness.
There are other standards of happiness
than the bucolic or than the self-complacence
of the constricted devotees of caste. Indeed, we in
America continue to doubt whether those states of
mind are truly happy. Content may or may not
mean happiness. It may be the calm, numb resignation
of despair. It may be the fat, swine-like
stupor of an established aristocracy. We have our
own ideas of happiness&mdash;and it is interesting to
note that these restless, forever unsatisfied longings
of ours tend to long life.</p>

<p>We are not unhappy; but neither are we happy,
nor likely to become so, until our corner of the
world, at least, is in far better order than it is at
present or likely to be soon.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of optimism. There is the
optimism of retreat&mdash;the kind our critics set up as
the harbinger of happiness. Our plutocrats preach
this optimism, and those of our politicians who are
fattening on the honors, salaries and spoils of office.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
&#8220;We are a great people,&#8221; they say. &#8220;Look at our
national wealth. Look at our per capita circulation
of money. Look at the totals of our production
of everything for man and beast. Let us rejoice
and do nothing to disturb our national prosperity.
Let us stop thinking&mdash;or, rather, let the
masses of the people give the plutocrats and the
politicians in power a free hand to do the thinking
and acting for the nation. Enough of this vulgar
and irritating discontent! Enough of the coarse,
low talk about wealth! Let us discuss art and
literature and glory and grandeur!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this with the most serious face in the world.
All this with perfect honesty and a heart full of
patriotism!</p>

<p>The answer of the American people is cruel.
&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; they say. They are not optimists of
retreat&mdash;for what but retreat is a progress
that advances a class at the expense of the
mass?</p>

<p>Theirs is the optimism of advance&mdash;the advance
of all. &#8220;We are indeed great,&#8221; they reply to the
optimists of retreat. &#8220;Let us be greater. What
Democracy we have had has carried us far. Let us
have more Democracy. The masses are better off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
than they used to be, thanks to the sweeping away
of some of the obstacles of class and caste. Let
us sweep away the rest of those obstacles.
What we have is good. It is the promise of
better. Let us see that that promise is redeemed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Happiness&mdash;in the customary, narrow sense&mdash;the
sense put into the word by the long past with its
reign of class and caste&mdash;that happiness we have
not. But the joy of life&mdash;the vigorous, bounding
hope that beats in the heart and throbs in the veins
of the strong man growing in strength&mdash;that we
have in ever fuller measure. Such happiness never
has been in the past? Such happiness cannot be
in a world of such abysmal natural inequalities?
We deny it. We are here not to live by the past,
by precedent, but to make a mockery of past and
precedent. We are the children of Democracy, not
the wards of aristocracy. We propose a wholly new
world&mdash;and we are putting our proposals into
effect. We have done well, though we have barely
begun. We shall do better. Another century or
so! We envy our grandchildren, not our grandfathers.</p>

<p>If happiness of the kind our ancestors of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>
world&#8217;s aristocratic days dreamed had been the objective
of the human race, man would have retained
his hairy coat, his taste for raw meat, his
pleasure in cave-dwelling. Every once in awhile
we see in America people whose object is happiness.
Sooner or later they arrive at the bottom. Sometimes
they are happy there. But, happy or not,
they are not to be envied or imitated. The dominant
note of the real slums is happiness. Don&#8217;t
be deceived by the squalor and rags into thinking
it misery. The unhappy slum-dwellers do not remain,
but restlessly and resolutely fight against the
bestial stupor, fight their way back to the light and
the joy of life.</p>

<p>The joy of life is the exaltation that comes
through a sense of a life lived to the very limit of
its possibilities; a life of self-development, self-expansion,
self-devotion to the emancipation of
man. Whoever you are, this joy of life can be
yours. Money has nothing to do with it, either in
aiding or retarding. Money cannot buy the essentials&mdash;health
and love. It cannot avert the essential
evils&mdash;illness, bereavement. The world keeps
finding this out from generation to generation&mdash;and
forgetting as soon as it rediscovers. Solomon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
mentioned the matter many centuries ago, when
he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; I
made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of
fruits; I made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth
forth trees; I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house;
also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem
before me; I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
of kings and of the provinces;....</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I looked on all these works that my hands had wrought and on the
labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of
spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Our rich men are largely responsible for the
misconception that the American people have no
ideal higher than that of money-making. The following
remarks once made by a rich philanthropist
are interesting because they are typical of the
thought of a great number of persons who speak
in public to-day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;In contributing to the education of the suffrage the rich are but building
for their own protection. If they neglect so to build, barbarism, anarchy,
plunder will be the inevitable result. If the spirit of commercialism and greed
continues to grow stronger, then the Twentieth Century will witness a social
cataclysm unparalleled in history.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Is all this true? Does the future of civilization
depend upon the generosity of rich men? If the
rich men do not awaken as a class and give more
largely to the uplifting of their fellow-men, shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
we have a carnival of barbarism, anarchy and
plunder?</p>

<p>The speaker and his kind of social students mean
well. They are right in arousing the rich to a
deeper sense of duty to mankind. But they think
so intently upon their pet theory that they lose their
point of view. They exaggerate to hysteria the
importance of the rich. They are infected with the
dollar-worshiping craze which they profess to abhor.
They vastly over-estimate concentrated wealth
as a factor in human progress. They erect money
into a powerful deity, just as do all other worshipers
of the dollar. The difference is that they wish
to make it a benevolent deity.</p>

<p>It is an excellent thing that the rich should be
aroused. A rich man who does nothing for his
brother-man is a contemptible fellow&mdash;almost as
contemptible as a poor man who does nothing for
his brother-man. The selfish rich man can plead in
extenuation that temptations, beyond human nature&#8217;s
power to combat, have narrowed and chilled
and withered him. But, save ignorance, what excuse
has the poor man for selfishness? However,
if by chance the selfish rich man become aroused
and give&mdash;give manlily, democratically&mdash;of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
riches, he must not be excited about the importance
to others of what he has done. Its main importance
is purely personal. He is a better man for
doing it and has a stronger title to self-respect.
But if he had not done it, the poor, old, stupid,
blundering human race would have managed to
stagger along somehow.</p>

<p>By all means let the rich give. For their own
self-respect, for their own self-satisfaction, they
ought to give largely and intelligently. Let the
honest rich give in sympathy&mdash;let the dishonest
give in humility. But we must remember that all
such gifts put together are as a mere drop in the
ocean so far as the effect upon civilization is concerned.</p>

<p>We have not reached our present estate through
the generosity of any class of men. And we shall
not advance to our destined higher estate because
of the generosity and benevolence of any class.
The benevolence of the rich may earn for them an
honorable place in the procession of humanity ever
toiling upward, and may enable laggards or the
too heavily handicapped to keep in line. But this
procession, that has marched on over kings and
emperors, over tyrants and oppressors and false<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
teachers, that has met and swept away army after
army of embattled wrong, is not to be perceptibly
retarded or accelerated by the errors or the virtues
of a class of men who are merely rich.</p>

<p>Rich men did not implant in the human heart
the all but universal passion for progress. Rich
men did not put into the human skull the marvelous
mechanism of the human mind. Rich men
did not endow that mind with the body to carry
out its will. Wealth has not made the great pictures
or paintings, has not written the great books
nor achieved the great discoveries, nor erected the
great institutions, nor evolved any of the glories of
the emancipation of man, social, political, industrial,
intellectual. <i>All</i> these we owe to men in
whom the wealth-getting instinct was at most a
shriveled rudiment. Wealth did not build this Republic
in its present majesty; Pliny the younger said&mdash;and
said truly&mdash;that wealth had ruined Rome.
Concentrated wealth, breeder of parasitism and
patronage, has shriveled and rotted&mdash;always,
everywhere. If history had not been written by
snobs and persons tainted with aristocratic error,
this fact would be as clear as print could make it.</p>

<p>The real wealth, the real riches of humanity are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
these capable minds and capable bodies, the creators
of intelligent, progress-producing thought
and action.</p>

<p>The value of civilization, of an orderly social
system, is great to, and is keenly felt by, the rich.
But that value is just as great to, just as keenly
felt by, the masses. Are they not wholly dependent
upon it for well-being, just as are the rich&mdash;no
more, no less?</p>

<p>And the work of preparing the oncoming generation
for the preservation and improvement of
the social structure is done in each generation not
by the rich, not by generosity and benevolence, but
by the masses themselves in a myriad of homes,
in a myriad of schoolhouses, in the hourly personal
and helpful intercourse of a myriad intelligent,
aspiring men, women and children. It is not concentrated
wealth that places the resources of the
world at the disposal of the masses. It is the intelligence
of the masses, demanding those resources,
that enables concentrated wealth to gain its too
often hideously unjust demands. Concentrated
wealth may to a limited extent promote progress;
but that is overbalanced by the fact that concentrated
wealth still more heavily penalizes progress.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>If civilization, freedom, love of order, were dependent
for their existence or spread in any large
degree upon the rich philanthropist and his fellow-millionaires,
cataclysm would be a mild word for
what would be about to befall us.</p>

<p>As for the &#8220;spirit of commercialism and greed,&#8221;
what reason is there to suppose it stronger now
than in the past? Because the wealth-producing
capacity of the masses has enormously increased,
because the opportunities for earning comfort have
infinitely multiplied, because millions are striving
for prosperity now where the few once monopolized
it all&mdash;are these reasons for accusing us to-day
of being greedy and growing greedier?</p>

<p>Was there ever a time or a place in history where
mere money was so powerless and brains so mighty
as the present day in the American Republic? Was
there ever a time or place where the individual man
was at once so powerful to protect his own rights
to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and so
powerless to snatch away those rights from others?</p>

<p>The conscientious rich man does well to try to
whip his fellow-millionaires into line with the procession.
But he need not torment his declining
years with horrid visions of coming anarchy if these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span>
rich men do not stop groveling and grasping and
begin to entertain worthy ambitions. Let the rich
do their part; but let every man, rich or poor, high
or humble, remember that his first duty is to see
that he is doing his own part.</p>

<p>One loses patience with the constant precedence
given the idea that riches alone mean success. Why
is it that the only men who are eagerly interviewed
and importuned to write articles on &#8220;the secret of
success&#8221; are multi-millionaires?</p>

<p>Are there no successful men but multi-millionaires?
There are not more than five thousand of
them in the country. Carlyle once described England
as &#8220;inhabited by thirty millions, mostly fools.&#8221;
And our own country, if none has succeeded in it
but the multi-millionaires, may be described as inhabited
by &#8220;eighty millions, mostly failures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Success is a glittering word, capable of many
meanings. A man is not necessarily a failure because
he has not made money&mdash;a million dollars or
a hundred. Some very successful men have never
tried to make money. They preferred to make
<i>something</i>, and if they achieved their desires they
succeeded&mdash;from their own viewpoint, at least.</p>

<p>Agassiz would not accept five thousand dollars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
a night to lecture. &#8220;I have no time to make
money,&#8221; he said. Scientific inquiry and discovery
were the objects of his life, and he succeeded in his
pursuit of them. Wellington, after conquering
Mysore, was proffered a gift of five hundred thousand
dollars by the corrupt East Indian Company.
He refused to touch it. Piling up &#8220;big money&#8221;
was not his idea of success, either.</p>

<p>When John Hancock, one of the signers of our
great Declaration, was sitting in the Continental
Congress a letter was read from Washington suggesting
the destruction of Boston by bombardment.
Hancock was one of Boston&#8217;s largest property owners,
but he instantly said: &#8220;All my property is in
Boston; but if the expulsion of the British from
it require that Boston be burnt to ashes, issue the
order immediately.&#8221; There was another man who
didn&#8217;t believe that &#8220;success&#8221; was only another name
for millions.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner refused to lecture at any price.
&#8220;My time belongs to Massachusetts and the nation,&#8221;
he said. Big money was not his idol.
Thomas Jefferson died insolvent. Was he therefore
a failure? Abraham Lincoln died a poor
man. Was he also a failure? Grant died so poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
that his opinion on &#8220;how to succeed&#8221; would have
been of no value to the money-mad, even if he had
left it.</p>

<p>Finally, can you imagine any of the great real
benefactors of mankind plotting to make the service
they rendered a heavy tax upon posterity for
maintaining their descendants in foolish idleness
and luxury?</p>

<p>Sooner or later there will be a reaction from this
search for &#8220;the secret of success&#8221; among the trust
kings and the sudden-rich heroes of the stock ticker.
&#8220;I know of no great men,&#8221; says Voltaire, &#8220;except
those who have rendered great service to the human
race.&#8221; Judged by that true standard, the
mere makers of &#8220;big money&#8221; cannot tell our young
men the &#8220;secret of success.&#8221; They do not know it
themselves.</p>

<p>The money success is blatant and strong. It
flaunts itself and tries to absorb all attention. But
it ought not to deceive any but the superficial observers
of the American people. Our ideals still
centre in the affections, not in the appetites. To
be free, to love, to think, to grow&mdash;the joy of life.
That sums up America. Gilt may for the moment
reign; but gilt does not rule.</p>

<small>THE MAN OF TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Chicago, in Lincoln Park, there is a wonderful
statue. A big, slouching form, loose yet powerful;
ungraceful, yet splendid because it seems to
be able to bear upon its Atlantean shoulders the
burdens of a mighty people. The big hands, the
big feet, the great, stooped shoulders tell the same
story of commonness and strength.</p>

<p>Then you look at the face. You find it difficult
to keep your hat upon your head.</p>

<p>What a countenance! How homely, yet how
beautiful; how stern, yet how gentle; how inflexible,
yet how infinitely merciful; how powerful, yet
how tender; how common, yet how sublime!</p>

<p>Search the world through and you will find no
greater statue than this&mdash;the statue of Abraham
Lincoln, by St. Gaudens. It is Lincoln; but it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
also a great deal more. It is the glorification of
the Common Man&mdash;the apotheosis of Democracy.</p>

<p>As you look at that face and that figure you
feel the history of the human race, the long, the
bloody, the agonized struggle of the masses of
mankind for freedom and light. You see the whole
history of your own country, founded by common
men for the common people, founded upon freedom
and equality and justice.</p>

<p>Here is no vain haughtiness, no arrogance, no
supercilious looking down, no cringing looking upward,
nothing that suggests class or rank or aristocracy.
Here is Democracy, the Common Man exalted
in the dignity of his own rights, in the splendor
of the recognition of the equal rights of all
others; the Common Man, free and enlightened,
strong and just.</p>

<p>The statue is in the attitude of preparation to
speak. What is that brain formulating for those
lips to utter?</p>

<p>The expression of brow and eyes and lips leaves
no doubt. It is some thought of freedom and justice,
some one of those many mighty democratic
thoughts which will echo forever in the minds and
hearts of men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>Let us recall three of those thoughts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The authors of the Declaration of Independence meant it to be a stumbling
block to those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back
into the hateful paths of despotism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that
government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish
from the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say that no man is good enough to govern another man without that
other man&#8217;s consent. I say that this is the leading principle, the sheet-anchor.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>These were the ideas that found this country a
few ragged settlements trembling between a hostile
sea and a hostile wilderness and built it up to its
present estate of democratic grandeur. Not tyranny,
not murder disguised as war, not robbery
disguised as &#8220;benevolent guidance,&#8221; not any of the
false and foolish ideas of imperialism and aristocracy.
But ideas of peace, of equal rights for all,
of self-government.</p>

<p>Our era, conscious of the mighty works that can
be wrought, conscious that we are all under sentence
of speedy death, eagerly seeks out the young
man, the obscure man. It has need of all powers
and all talents, especially of the talents for creating,
organizing, directing. Instead of it being true
that a good man doesn&#8217;t have a chance any more,
the reverse is true&mdash;inferior men have chances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>
greatly beyond their powers, and immature men
are forced into important commands, and discredited
and ruined, so impatient is the pressure for
men to do the world&#8217;s important work. This is
the day of the man who wants a chance.</p>

<p>It is also a day in which we hear a great deal
about the &#8220;unruly class.&#8221; This phrase is employed
to designate some vague element in the masses of
the people that is naturally turbulent and ever looking
about for an excuse to &#8220;rise&#8221; and &#8220;burn, slay,
kill.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may search through history page by page,
line by line, and you will find no trace of the doings
of this alleged &#8220;unruly class.&#8221; The more you read
the more you will be struck by the universal and
most tenacious love of quiet and order in the masses
of mankind. You will see them robbed, oppressed,
murdered wholesale upon mere caprice, the victims
of all manner of misery. Your cheeks will burn
and your blood run hot as you read. And you will
note with wonder that they endured with seemingly
limitless patience until they were eating grass
by the wayside. Then, once in a while, but only
once in a while, they &#8220;rose.&#8221; All the machinery
of law and order was in the hands of the oppressors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>
so they were compelled to resort to violence.
But even then they established new machinery
or patched up the old as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><i>Every society that has been overturned from,
within has been overturned by misrule; never by
the unruly.</i></p>

<p>No; the real &#8220;unruly classes&#8221; are these &#8220;respectabilities&#8221;
with the &#8220;pulls,&#8221; and these governmental
officers who are &#8220;pulled&#8221;;&mdash;they violate the laws;
they purchase or enact or enforce unjust legislation;
they abuse the confidence and the tolerant
good nature of the people; they misuse the machinery
of justice.</p>

<p>Turn to your history again. You find that every
once in a while the dominant element has begun
to talk about the &#8220;unruly class,&#8221; to express fear of
&#8220;risings,&#8221; of mob violence. And in every instance
you find that the real reason for this denunciation
and dread was that the dominant element had begun
to be acutely conscious of its own misdeeds.
It feared that its own weapons of injustice would
be turned against itself by outraged justice. It
feared that its punishment would be in proportion
to its crimes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span>Gladstone said that the Nineteenth century was
summed up in the phrase, &#8220;Unhand me!&#8221; Its
science struck off the shackles of ignorance upon
the intellect&mdash;shackles of error, of false reverence,
of superstitions about the causes of the inequalities
of men. Thus, the Nineteenth century made it possible
for this to be the Age of the Common Man.
Not to states, not to institutions, not to class-made
law, not to castes and orders and rank belongs the
Twentieth century. It belongs to the Common Man&mdash;to
you. You with your stout heart and your willing
and capable hands. You with your active, intelligent
brain, impatient of traditional nonsense,
however poetically or plausibly englamoured. You
with your enlightened sense of the equal rights of
all men. You with your passionate resolve scientifically
to correct the stupid and cruel inequalities
of opportunity, that are as intolerable in an era of
science as a cannibal feast in the temple of the
Most High.</p>

<p>What is the watchword of this new day? From
lip to lip, from land to land, from race to race,
flies the &#8220;password eternal&#8221;&mdash;Democracy.</p>

<p>How the Nineteenth century did belie all the
prophecies of pessimism! And how the Twentieth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[Pg 294]</span>
century will belie all the prophecies of its pessimists!</p>

<p>To realize this you must penetrate the dust and
noise and clamor that are the surface of things.
You must discard prejudice and that narrowness
which makes you exaggerate the importance of the
things immediately at hand&mdash;the things that are
mere details of the great pattern which time is
weaving in the loom of history&mdash;details incomprehensible
unless you look at the pattern as a whole.
Disregard tradition and egotism; free yourself of
the small silliness that leads you to confuse intelligence
with etiquette and clothes, with formal education
which may or may not affect the intellect.
Look deep into the realities and see there the lines
of the Common Man&mdash;the toiler at the desk and
bench and lever and plow, his mind bent upon his
work, his work the improvement of his own condition
and the handing down of the heritage of life
richer and better in every way than he received it.</p>

<p>Through the ages this Common Man has been
building like the coral insect&mdash;silently, secretly,
steadily, strongly. History has little to say about
him or his work, and that little misleading; the
historians have been unable to get away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span>
courts and battlefields and the legislation halls
where fierce but futile and evanescent class struggles
rage. But the real story of the past of the
human race as an interpreter and prophet of the
future is the story of the building of the coral continent
founded broadly and deeply upon freedom
and justice, upon Intelligence and Democracy. And
now at last this continent of enduring civilization
begins to emerge not here and there, not merely
above the ebbtides of ignorance and tyranny, but
everywhere and for all time.</p>

<p>Let us read the past aright. Its departed civilizations
are not a gloomy warning, but a bright
promise. If limited intelligence in a small class
produced such gleams of glory in the black sky of
history, what a day must be now dawning!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
